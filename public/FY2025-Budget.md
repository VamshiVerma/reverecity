# City Council Unanimously Approves Mayor Keefe's FY2025 Budget

![](_page_5_Picture_1.jpeg)

July 8, 2024

REVERE, MA – This week the Revere City Council unanimously approved the City of Revere's FY2025 Budget. Prepared and submitted by Mayor Patrick M. Keefe Jr. and Chief Financial Officer Rich Viscay, the FY2025 budget totals \$274 million, with nearly 70% of investments focused on Revere Public Schools, public safety, and public infrastructure. No one-time revenues were required to balance the budget.

With an eye towards providing equitable municipal resources and services, Mayor Keefe also emphasized his goals of benefitting neighborhoods and fostering local economic development. "The approval of this budget affirms some of the key initiatives that this administration has prioritized: developing a culture based on results, and achieving a common goal. I'm proud of all the teamwork that went into it, including the City Councilors who made every consideration to ensure that the right decisions were being made for our taxpayers," stated Mayor Keefe. "We want to do what's right by our residents, our businesses, and our neighborhoods. I feel confidently that this budget reflects that effort."

CFO Rich Viscay added, "I want to thank all of the departments who collaborated on this budget. I also want to thank the City Council for their vote, and to my team for their hard work in preparing this budget."

#### **FY2025 Budget Highlights**

Investments in Public Education: Nearly 44% of the FY2025 budget is dedicated to Revere Public Schools. The City Council appropriated \$126,284,616 for Revere Public Schools in FY2025, \$102,000,000 of which is Chapter 70 funding provided by the State, as the City works toward full funding of the Student Opportunity Act by FY2027. Revere Public Schools continues to work toward district goals of purchasing

new instructional tools, upgrading technology and facilities, and providing appropriate supplemental services for all students.

Investments in Public Safety: The FY2025 budget increases uniformed police officers from 115 to 117, and firefighters from 119 to 121.

Reorganization and Increased Efficiency: Strategic planning is at the forefront of this administration's mission, with the aim of consolidating and centralizing city services to benefit residents and personnel alike. Mayor Keefe initiated a major departmental reorganization to ensure ease of access to resources for residents, and emphasized his mission to protect the tax dollar. Some of the consolidation includes commonsense solutions, such as incorporating Consumer Affairs into Constituent Services (311), and consolidating DEI, the Community School, and Talent and Culture under the umbrella of Human Resources. In addition, the DPW, Water and Sewer Enterprise, and Engineering Departments were reorganized to increase productivity, and the Parks and Recreation department was re-envisioned to accommodate their expanded offerings, including the Haas Health and Wellness Center.

# **Section I - General Overview**

# Overview – City of Revere

The City of Revere is located on the eastern coast of Massachusetts and is bordered by Boston, Winthrop, and Chelsea on the south, Everett and Malden on the west, Saugus and Lynn on the north, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. The City has a population of approximately 53,073 (according to the 2020 U.S. Census) and occupies a land area of 5.95 square miles. Settled in 1626 and originally a part of Chelsea, Revere was established as a separate town in 1871 and incorporated as a city in 1915. It is primarily a residential suburb of Boston.

#### Form of Government

The City operates under the Plan B form of government with an elected Mayor and an eleven-member City Council. The Mayor is elected for a four-year term, and Councilors are elected for two-year terms.

#### **Municipal Services**

The City provides general governmental services for the territory within its boundaries, including police and fire protection, disposal of solid waste, public education, street maintenance, parks, and recreational facilities.

The City is located in Suffolk County but is not assessed any of the costs of county operations, the County tax being paid in its entirety by the City of Boston. The principal services provided by the County are a jail, a house of correction and a registry of deeds. Complete sewer and water services are provided by the City via connections to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA).

The City has a service agreement with Refuse Energy Systems Company (RESCO), under which RESCO is required to accept the City's municipal solid waste for disposal at its Saugus incineration facility.

#### Coronavirus (COVID-19) Disclosure

COVID-19 is a new respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. On March 10, 2020, the Governor of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts declared a state of emergency to support the Commonwealth's response to the outbreak of the virus. On March 11, 2020,

the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. On March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency due to the outbreak, which has enabled disaster funds to be made available to states to fight the pandemic. On March 15, 2020, the Governor announced emergency actions to help address the spread of the virus, and as a result the City closed all municipal buildings to the public through May 25, 2020. City Hall is now open without an appointment, but masks are required inside all City buildings. The City is adhering to these actions by strictly following the most updated public health recommendations. City employees are currently reporting to work as normal, maintaining all essential functions and services.

The City was awarded a total of \$30 million in Coronavirus local fiscal recovery funds in FY2021. Of this amount, \$30 million has been committed to various recovery efforts, investing \$5 million in the public sector workforce, \$9 million in water and sewer infrastructure improvements, \$2 million towards the development of a new health and wellness center for the community, \$1 million in assistance to local affected businesses and nonprofits, \$2 million to respond to the coronavirus public health emergency, \$10 million to respond to the negative economic impacts of the coronavirus, and \$1 million for travel and tourism. In addition, the City has received additional funding from FEMA, a CDBG grant to our Planning and Community Development department, a DPH grant for the Health Department, and ESSER funds for the School Department to address specific Covid-related areas.

For fiscal 2021, the City had lowered its estimated receipts by 12.5%, with larger decreases anticipated in the local meals and room tax. New growth for FY2022 increased vs projected by \$1.2 million, which eliminated the need to use \$1 million in revenue replacement from free cash that had been budgeted for FY2021. Local receipts are ticking back up closer to pre pandemic levels in most areas.

#### Education

The Revere Public School system consists of a total of eight schools: six elementary schools, two of which are also K-8, a middle school, and one high school. There are also two parochial schools located in the City. The Northeast Metropolitan Regional Vocational School District has 1,294 students, approximately 256 of whom are from Revere.

#### Climate Resiliency

The City of Revere constructs a series of planning documents and guides to direct and articulate its vision for the future of Revere. These guides and policies are formulated by its professional and experienced planning team in the Department of Planning & Community Development with input from other municipal, regional, and state officials; nonprofits and local businesses; and community organizations and residents.

The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) requires that after November 1, 2004, all municipalities that wish to continue to be eligible to for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) funding to adopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan, which must be updated in five-year intervals. This planning requirement does not affect post-disaster Public Assistance (PA) funding. Revere completed its Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) in 2005, and previously updated it in 2015. A final draft of the 2022 Hazard Mitigation Plan has been accepted by FEMA/MEMA and is now awaiting the Revere City Council's adoption of the plan.

A significant revision to the City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan (2022 Update) includes the reorganization of natural hazards through the context of climate change to reflect the increasing urgency of climate change. This is consistent with the approach taken in the Massachusetts State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan – 2018 (2018 SHMCAP). Furthermore, FEMA's National Risk Index (NRI) was leveraged to update the risk analysis and loss estimation. While there are some limitations with regards to analyzing NRI data at the local scale, it serves as a useful starting point to estimate damages from the following natural hazards for which loss estimates were not provided in the 2015 Update of the City of Revere Hazard Mitigation Plan (2015 Update): drought, landslides, hurricanes (beyond wind), severe winter storms, and tornadoes. The 2022 Update also reflects changes in flood risk from the 2017 update to the FEMA-delineated Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Lastly, the mitigation goals and actions identified in the Hazard Mitigation Strategy were revised in accordance with the needs of the community.

As with previous updates, the 2018 SHMCAP was leveraged as a starting point to identify potential hazards and the risk they present to the Commonwealth. A significant change in the 2018 SHMCAP compared to prior versions is the framing of potential hazards through lens of climate change interactions, which include changes in precipitation, sea level rise, rising temperatures, and extreme weather. The effects of climate change on each hazard, as identified in the 2018 SHMCAP, were incorporated into the Risk Assessment.

The City's climate, geography, and demography significantly determine its risk and vulnerability to impacts from natural hazards. Because risk is at the nexus of natural hazards, human life and critical infrastructure, this Risk Assessment begins with a review of Revere's community profile. The community profile includes a review of the City's social and economic profile, followed by the land use profile and a review of development trends. Finally, the community profile includes a review of the City's climate, which affects many hazards the City may be vulnerable to and summarizes how the City's climate has changed in recent decades.

The Risk Assessment continues with a description of future climate projections in the city followed by a review of all potential natural hazard events that may occur in the City, leveraging work completed as part of the 2018 SHMCAP and the 2019 Revere Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (Revere MVP, 2019) Summary of Findings Report to identify potential hazards.

Neighboring communities were invited to review and provide comments on the draft update, which was posted on the City's website for public viewing. As previously stated, the City recognizes hazard mitigation planning should not occur independent of other community and resilience planning activities. The City is engaged with the neighboring communities of Chelsea and Winthrop through the newly established North Suffolk Office of Resiliency and Sustainability (NSORS). The two new staff members are advancing regional efforts and securing grant funding. The City has also been coordinating with the neighboring communities; Lynn, Saugus, Malden, and Everett to progress regional flood mitigation efforts with an established a new regional working group. Funding has been secured for this regional flood mitigation working group via the Accelerating Climate Resiliency grant from MAPC that will be advanced this fiscal year.

The Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness grant program (MVP) provides support for cities and towns in Massachusetts to begin the process of planning for climate change resiliency and implementing priority projects. The State awards communities with funding to complete vulnerability assessments and develop action-oriented resiliency plans. Communities that complete the MVP program become certified as an MVP community and are eligible for MVP Action grant funding and other opportunities. Revere was deemed an MVP community in 2019 and subsequently secured two additional MVP Action grants, for a Coastal Resiliency Study for the Point of Pines and Riverside neighborhoods, and a Planning grant for Stormwater Storage at Gibson Park. The City employs an environmental planner to lead the use of the funding and is further supported by the Department of Planning & Community Development.

In addition, the City has been coordinating regularly with the City of Boston to improve coastal flood resilience at Suffolk Downs, which encompasses portions of both cities. The cities are collaborating to identify opportunities for flood protection alignments based on existing physical conditions, the location of flood pathways, and the extent of flooding.

Further coordination between resiliency planning and the City's broader community, housing, economic development, and other goals are outlined in the City's Next Stop Revere Master Plan, the City's first comprehensive master plan developed in more than four decades. Among other objectives, the plan aims to promote resiliency of the City in the face of increasing climate challenges through comprehensive climate mitigation and resiliency strategies and energy efficiency programs and to position City government at the forefront of regional collaboration, climate resiliency, and mitigation programs.

In summary, the City has several plans in place to address climate resiliency and will continue to update and revise them as new information becomes available.

#### Cybersecurity

The City has extensive procedures and processes in place and regular employee training regarding cybersecurity.

#### **Economic Development**

Recognizing that the City of Revere needs commercial development to ensure a solid tax base, the City has taken an aggressive approach in recent years to expand and diversify its commercial tax base. These efforts have yielded significant success and many continuing prospects for further economic growth. In virtually every corner of the City, economic development is moving forward. The City of Revere has cultivated a robust development pipeline in recent years, allowing both the City and developers to benefit from immense regional demand in the residential and commercial sectors. The City of Revere has become a very desirable location with its ideal access to Boston via its 3 MBTA stations and bus lines and 3-mile crescent beach as well as its proximity to Logan Airport and major highways.

One of the largest mixed-use developments in the Commonwealth. was approved by the Revere City Council in 2018 at the 160-acre Suffolk Downs Racetrack, 52 acres of which are in Revere. The master planned unit development by the HYM Investment Group, LLC will generate over the next 15-20 years approximately 5.8 million gross square feet of commercial, residential, and civic/recreational space across the Revere portion of the site, with residential uses comprising no more than 50%, and commercial uses no less than 50%. This master planned development will be constructed in 4 phases beginning at Beachmont Square adjacent to the Beachmont T Station, with residential uses originally expected to be predominant (80/20 ratio) during this first phase. Recent indications are that commercial development will exceed that target with the announcement of a major new bio-tech manufacturing facility not initially planned for phase 1, which suggests that overall commercial development may well exceed 50% of the build-out. The total mixed-use

project will consist of 2.9 million gross square feet of commercial uses including an Innovation Center, hotels, office buildings, restaurants, and retail and 2.9 million gross square feet of residential uses. Construction of the first phase began in 2021.

Also on the horizon is the development of the vacant 34-acre former Wonderland Greyhound Racetrack (the "Wonderland Property"). This site represents a key opportunity for further economic development in the City of Revere given its prime location on Route 1A and ideal access to the adjacent Wonderland T Station and Commuter Rail. The City is currently undertaking a master plan and rezoning of this site to include construction of a new high school to serve approximately 2,450 students. The City acquired the Wonderland Property by eminent domain. CBW Lending, LLC, the former owner of the Wonderland Property filed a lawsuit against the City over the price of the taking of the Wonderland Property by eminent domain. The City is confident that it acquired the Wonderland Property for fair market value. However, there can be no assurance that the City will be successful in any such defense.

In the City's center, the New England Confectionary Company (NECCO), the internationally famous candy manufacturer, recently sold its 800,000 gsf building to a real estate investment firm who has signed a long-term lease with Amazon for the operation of a major Amazon distribution center which opened in 2020. A second Amazon distribution facility comprising 136,433 gsf has been constructed at 565 Squire Road in 2023 and is currently operational.

Many development projects have been completed along Revere Beach. After lengthy negotiations, the City has completed an agreement with the Commonwealth's Department of Conservation and Recreation and the MBTA for the development of almost 9 acres of surface parking lots east of the Wonderland Train Station. The Governor's Office of Commonwealth Development has identified this site as one of its priority Transit Oriented Development locations and has worked closely with the City in the development of a Request for Proposals for dense mixed-use development on the site. The City of Revere has designated Eurovest Development as the master developer of the site known as Waterfront Square. Development on this site has been ongoing for the last several years and is nearing completion in 2024. Most recently completed developments include 650 Ocean Avenue consisting of 230 luxury rental units, the Eliot at 660 Ocean Avenue consisting of 194 luxury rental units, 500 Ocean Ave. consisting of a mixed-use development comprising 305 residential units and two restaurants, the Robinson at 656 Ocean Ave. comprising 230 residential units, and 646 Ocean Ave. comprising 213 residential units. These developments have provided substantial growth for the City and sparked a development explosion along the Revere Beach waterfront area. In addition to these mixed-use residential development projects, a new Marriot Hotel at 400 Ocean Avenue with 172 rooms and a 3,000 gsf restaurant and Starbucks was completed in 2020. All told, new development within Waterfront Square has accounted for 1,172 new residential units, a 172 key hotel and 4 restaurants

Both the southern and northern ends of Revere Beach are experiencing aggressive development growth as well including the completion of a 234-unit luxury apartment project at 540 Revere Beach Boulevard called the "Beach House" by Baystone Development and the completion of a mixed use 145 residential unit development at 320 Revere Beach Boulevard. Adjacent to the "Beach House" construction of a 360-unit residential development by Mill Creek development is underway on an approximate 3-acre vacant site at 580 Revere Beach Boulevard and is slated for completion in 2026.

On the southerly end of Revere Beach there are several commercial and residential mixed-use projects that have been completed to date including the 127 mixed use Ryder development at 21 Revere Beach Boulevard, 73 residential units at 50 Ocean Avenue, and 75 residential units at 90 Ocean Ave. Projects in

the construction stage include a 75-unit residential project at 110 Ocean Avenue, and a 16-unit residential project at 37 Revere Beach Boulevard which are slated for occupancy in 2026. In addition, a mixed-use residential development comprising of 135 residential condominium units and 2,000 gsf of commercial space is currently in the permitting phase at 50 Revere Beach Boulevard.

The City is also seeing strong commercial and residential mixed-use developments within the Shirley Avenue neighborhood adjacent to Revere Beach. Completed projects to date include: completion of a 35-unit mixed use development at 43 Nahant Ave. in 2020; completion of an 8-unit mixed use building at 17 Dehon St.; completion of a 14 unit residential building at 1540 North Shore Road; completion of a 27 unit mixed use residential building at 94 Shirley Ave.; completion of an 18-unit residential building at 177 Shirley Ave.; completion of a 45-unit mixed use building at 180 Shirley Ave.; completion of an 18-unit residential building at 57 Shirley Ave.; completion of a 16-unit residential building at 1510 North Shore Road; completion of a 45-unit mixed use building at 60 Shirley Ave.; completion of a 30-unit residential building at 38 Walnut Ave.; completion of a 38-unit residential building at 1499 North Shore Road; completion of a 20-unit residential building at 13 Nahant Ave.;

# PROPERTY TAXATION

The principal revenue source of the City is the tax on real and personal property. The amount to be levied in each year is the amount appropriated or required by law to be raised for municipal expenditures less estimated receipts from other sources and less appropriations voted from funds on hand. The total amount levied is subject to certain limits prescribed by law. See 'Tax Limitations' herein. As to the mandatory inclusion of debt service and final judgments, see "Security and Remedies," above.

The estimated receipts for a fiscal year from sources other than the property tax may not exceed the actual receipts during the preceding fiscal year from the same sources unless approved by the State Commissioner of Revenue. Excepting special funds, the use of which is otherwise provided for by law, the deduction for appropriations voted from funds on hand for a fiscal year cannot exceed "free cash" as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year as certified by the State Director of Accounts plus up to nine months' collections and receipts on account of earlier years' taxes after that date. Subject to certain adjustments, free cash is surplus revenue less uncollected overdue property taxes from earlier years.

Although an allowance is made in the tax levy for abatements (see "Overlay" below) no reserve is generally provided for uncollectible real property taxes. Since some of the levy is inevitably not collected, this creates a cash deficiency which may or may not be offset by other items (see "Taxation to Meet Deficits" below).

## **Tax Levy Computation**

The following table illustrates the trend in the manner in which the tax levy was determined in recent years.

#### Assessed Valuations and Tax Levies

Property is classified for the purpose of taxation according to its use. The legislature has in substance created three classes of taxable property: (1) residential real property, (2) open space land, and (3) all other (commercial, industrial, and personal property). Within limits, cities and towns are given the option of determining the share of the annual levy to be borne by each of the three categories. The share required to be borne by residential real property is at least 50 per cent of its share of the total taxable valuation; the effective rate for open space must be at least 75 per cent of the effective rate for residential real property; and the share of commercial, industrial, and personal property must not exceed 175 percent of their share of the total valuation. A city or town may also exempt up to 20 percent of the valuation of residential real property (where used as the taxpayer's principal residence) and up to 10 percent of the valuation of commercial real property (where occupied by certain small businesses). Property may not be classified in a city or town until the State Commissioner of Revenue certifies that all property in the city or town has been assessed at its fair cash value. Such certification must take place every five years, or pursuant to a revised schedule as may be issued by the Commissioner.

Related statutes provide that certain forest land, agricultural or horticultural land (assessed at the value it has for these purposes) and recreational land (assessed on the basis of its use at a maximum of 25 percent of its fair cash value) are all to be taxed at the rate applicable to commercial property. Land classified as forest land is valued for this purpose at five percent of fair cash value but not less than ten dollars per acre.

Local assessed valuations are determined annually as of January 1 and used for the fiscal year beginning on the next July 1. The City completed professional revaluations of all real and personal property to full value for use in fiscal 1984, and most recently for use in fiscal 2018. The City's local tax rates in said fiscal years are believed to have approximated full value tax rates. (See "Tax limitations," below.)

Local

The City has used multiple tax rates under classification since fiscal 1983 when it revalued all real and personal property in the City to full value.

The following table sets forth the trend in the City's assessed and equalized valuations.

# State Equalized Valuation

In order to determine appropriate relative values for the purposes of certain distributions to and assessments upon cities and towns, the Commissioner of Revenue biennially makes a redetermination of the fair cash value of the taxable property in each municipality as of January 1 of even numbered years. This is known as the "equalized value." The following table sets forth the trend in equalized valuations of the City.

### Table: State Equalized Valuations

| January 1 | State Equalized Valuations | Percentage Increase/Decrease |
|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2020      | \$ 7,759,126,900           | 21.23 %                      |

## Overlay and Abatements

The City is authorized to increase each tax levy by an amount approved by the State Commissioner of Revenue as an "overlay" to provide for tax abatements. If abatements are granted in excess of the applicable overlay reserve, the excess is required to be added to the next tax levy. Abatements are granted where exempt real or personal property has been assessed or where taxable real or personal property has been overvalued or disproportionately valued. They may abate real and personal property taxes on broad grounds (including inability to pay) with the approval of the State Commissioner of Revenue.

The following table sets forth the amount of the overlay reserve for the fiscal years shown.

### Table: Overlay Reserve for Fiscal Years

# Tax Levies and Collections

Prior to the fiscal year 1992, the taxes for each fiscal year were due in two installments on November 1 (subject to deferral if tax bills are sent out late) and May 1. However, beginning in fiscal 1992 the City instituted quarterly billing of real and personal property taxes, with tax bills payable August 1, November 1, February 1 and May 1 of each fiscal year. Interest accrues on delinquent taxes currently at the rate of 14 percent per annum. Real property (land and buildings) is subject to a lien for the taxes assessed upon it (subject to any paramount federal lien and subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws). (In addition, real property is subject to a lien for certain unpaid municipal charges or fees.) If the property has not been transferred, an unenforced lien expires on the fourth December 31 after the fiscal year to which the tax relates. If the property has not been transferred by the fourth December 31, an unenforced lien expires upon a later transfer of the property. Provision is made, however, for continuation of the lien where it could not be enforced because of a legal impediment. The persons against whom real or personal property taxes are assessed are personally liable for the tax (subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws). In the case of real property, this personal liability is effectively extinguished by sale or taking of the property as described below.

The City has taken several measures to improve its tax collection efforts. In 1991, the City's policies regarding tax collections were changed. The Treasurer was appointed Treasurer and Collector and additional resources were allocated to aggressively collect taxes. The Treasurer and Collector's Office developed a computer software system that has shortened the time necessary to process delinquencies and file liens on property with the Registry of Deeds.

The following table compares the City's net tax collections with its net tax levies (gross tax levy less overlay reserve for abatements):

#### Tax Titles and Possessions

Massachusetts law permits a municipality either to sell by public sale (at which the municipality may become the purchaser) or to take real property for nonpayment of taxes. In either case, the property owner can redeem the property by paying the unpaid taxes, with interest and other charges, but if the right to redemption is not exercised within six months (which may be extended an additional year in the case of certain installment payments) it can be foreclosed or taken by the municipality, becoming a "tax possession," which may be held and disposed of in the same manner as other land held for municipal purposes.

Uncollectible real property taxes are ordinarily not written off until they become municipal tax titles (either by purchase at the public sale or by taking), at which time the tax is written off in full by reserving the amount of tax and charging surplus. Tax Title is the actual lien on the deed of the property at the Registry of Deeds. The collections of tax titles follows different status than delinquent taxes.

The City has instituted a policy to sell properties that are foreclosed by the land court at public auction. Such auctions have resulted in revenues to the City in the amount of \$259,991 in fiscal 2015, \$920,000 in fiscal 2016, \$519,072 in fiscal 2017, \$372,534 in fiscal 2018 and \$655,920 in fiscal 2021.

#### **Taxation to Meet Deficits**

Overlay deficits, i.e., tax abatements (or refunds made) more than the overlay included in the tax levy to cover abatements, are required to be added to the next tax levy. It is generally understood that revenue deficits, i.e., those resulting from non-property tax revenues being less than anticipated, are also required to be added to the next tax levy (at least to the extent not covered by surplus revenue). Amounts lawfully expended since the prior tax levy and not included therein are also required to be included in the annual tax levy. The circumstances under which this can arise are limited since municipal departments are generally prohibited from incurring liabilities more than appropriations except for major disasters, mandated items, contracts in aid of housing and renewal projects and other long-term contracts. In addition, utilities must be paid at established rates and certain established salaries, e.g., civil service, must legally be paid for work performed, whether covered by appropriations.

Cities and towns are authorized to appropriate sums, and thus to levy taxes, to cover deficits arising from other causes, such as "free cash" deficits arising from a failure to collect taxes. This is not generally understood, however, and it has not been the practice to levy taxes to cover free cash deficits. Except

to the extent that such deficits have been reduced or eliminated by subsequent collections of uncollected taxes (including sales of tax titles and tax possessions), lapsed appropriations, non-property tax revenues more than estimates, other miscellaneous items or funding loans authorized by special act, they remain in existence.

#### Tax Limitations

Chapter 59, Section 21C of the General Laws, also known as Proposition 2½, imposes two separate limits on the annual tax levy of a city or town.

The primary limitation is that the tax levy cannot exceed 2½ percent of the full and fair cash value. If a city or town exceeds the primary limitation, it must reduce its tax levy by at least 15 percent annually until it complies, provided that the reduction can be reduced in any year to not less than 7½ percent by majority vote of the voters, or to less than 7½ percent by two-thirds vote of the voters.

For cities and towns at or below the primary limit, a secondary limitation is that the tax levy cannot exceed the maximum levy limit for the preceding fiscal year as determined by the State Commissioner of Revenue by more than 2½ percent, subject to exceptions for property added to the tax rolls or property which has had an increase, other than as part of a general revaluation, in its assessed valuation over the prior year's valuation.

This "growth" limit on the tax levy may be exceeded in any year by a majority vote of the voters, but an increase in the secondary or growth limit under this procedure does not permit a tax levy more than the primary limitation, since the two limitations apply independently. In addition, if the voters vote to approve taxes in excess of the "growth" limit for the purpose of funding a stabilization fund, such increased amount may only be taken into account for purposes of calculating the maximum levy limit in each subsequent year if the board of selectmen of a town or the city council of a city votes by a two-thirds vote to appropriate such increased amount in such subsequent year to the stabilization fund.

The applicable tax limits may also be reduced in any year by a majority vote of the voters.

The State Commissioner of Revenue may adjust any tax limit "to counterbalance the effects of extraordinary, non-recurring events which occurred during the base year."

The statute further provides that the voters may exclude from the taxes subject to the tax limits and from the calculation of the maximum tax levy (a) the amount required to pay debt service on bonds and notes issued before November 4, 1980, if the exclusion is approved by a majority vote of the voters, and (b) the amount required to pay debt service on any specific subsequent issue for which similar approval is obtained. Even with voter approval, the holders of the obligations for which unlimited taxes may be assessed do not have a statutory priority or security interest in the portion of the tax levy attributable to such obligations. It should be noted that Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 44, Section 20 requires that the taxes excluded from the levy limit to pay debt service on any such bonds and notes be calculated based on the true interest cost of the issue. Accordingly, the Department of Revenue limits the amount of taxes which may be levied in each year to pay debt service on any such bonds and notes to the amount of such debt service, less a pro rata portion of any original issue premium received by the city or town that was not applied to pay costs of issuance.

Voters may also exclude from the Proposition 2½ limits the amount required to pay specified capital outlay expenditures or for the city or town's apportioned share for certain capital outlay expenditures by a regional governmental unit. In addition, the city council of a city, with the approval of the mayor if required, or the board of selectmen or the town council of a town may vote to exclude from the Proposition 2½ limits taxes raised in lieu of sewer or water charges to pay debt service on bonds or notes issued by the municipality (or by an independent authority, commission or district) for water or sewer purposes, provided that the municipality's sewer or water charges are reduced accordingly.

In addition, Proposition 2½ limits the annual increase in the total assessments on cities and towns by any county, district, authority, the Commonwealth or any other governmental entity (except regional school districts, the MWRA and certain districts for which special legislation provides otherwise) to the sum of (a) 2½ percent of the prior year's assessments and (b) "any increases in costs, charges or fees for services customarily provided locally or for services subscribed to at local option". Regional water districts, regional sewerage districts and regional veterans' districts may exceed these limitations under statutory procedures requiring a two-thirds vote of the district's governing body and either approval of the local appropriating authorities (by two-thirds vote in districts with more than two members or by majority vote in two-member districts) or approval of the registered voters in a local election (in the case of two-member districts). Under Proposition 2½ any State law to take effect on or after January 1, 1981, imposing a direct service or cost obligation on a city or town will become effective only if accepted or voluntarily funded by the city or town or if State funding is provided. Similarly, State rules or regulations imposing additional costs on a city or town or laws granting or increasing local tax exemptions are to take effect only if adequate State appropriations are provided. These statutory provisions do not apply to costs resulting from judicial decisions.

The City has been in full compliance with Proposition 2 1/2 since fiscal 1984 following completion of a professional revaluation of all real and personal property in the City to full value.

#### Sale of Tax Receivables.

Cities and towns are authorized to sell delinquent property tax receivables by public sale or auction, either individually or in bulk.

#### **Pledged Taxes**

Taxes on certain property in designated development districts may be pledged for the payment of costs of economic development projects within such districts and may therefore be unavailable for other municipal purposes.

#### **Initiative Petitions**

Various proposals have been made in recent years for legislative amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution to impose limits on state and local taxes. To be adopted such amendments must be approved by two successive legislatures and then by the voters at a state election.

#### **CITY FINANCES**

#### **Budget and Appropriation Process**

In a city, within 170 days after the annual organization of the city government (which is ordinarily in early January), the Mayor is required to submit a budget of proposed expenditures for the fiscal year beginning on the next July 1. The city council may make appropriations for the recommended purposes and may reduce or reject any item. Without a recommendation from the Mayor, the council may not make any appropriation for a purpose not included in the proposed budget. The council may not increase any item without the recommendation of the Mayor (except as provided by legislation, subject to local acceptance, under which the school budget or regional school district assessment can be increased upon recommendation of the school committee or regional district school committee and by two-thirds vote of the council, provided that such increase does not cause the total annual budget to exceed property tax limitations). If the council fails to act on any item of the proposed budget within 45 days, that item takes effect.

If the Mayor does not make a timely budget submission, provision is made for preparation of a budget by the council. Provision is also made for supplementary appropriations upon recommendation of the Mayor. Water and sewer department expenditures are included in the budget adopted by the city council. Under certain legislation any city or town which accepts the legislation may provide that the appropriations for the operating costs of any department may be offset, in whole or in part, by estimated receipts from fees charged for services provided by the department. It is assumed that this general provision does not alter the pre-existing power of an electric department to appropriate its own receipts. The school budget is limited to the total amount appropriated by the city council, but the school committee retains full power to allocate the funds appropriated.

Under certain circumstances and subject to certain limits and requirements, the city council of a city, upon the recommendation of the mayor, may transfer amounts appropriated for the use of one department (except for a municipal light department or a school department) to another appropriation for the same department or for the use of any other department.

City department heads are generally required to submit their budget requests to the Mayor between December 1 and January 15. This does not apply to the school department, which must submit its requests in time for the Mayor to include them in his submission to the council.

State and county assessments, abatements in excess of overlays, principal and interest not otherwise provided for, and final judgments are included in the tax levy whether or not included in the budget. Revenues are not required to be set forth in the budget but estimated non-tax revenues are taken into account by the assessors in fixing the tax levy.

#### **Operating Budget Trends**

The following table sets forth the trend in general fund budgets. The budgets exclude expenditures for "non-operating" or extraordinary items:

|                                  | Fiscal 2018    | Fiscal 2019    | Fiscal 2020    | Fiscal 2021    | Fiscal 2022    |

The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) presented a Distinguished Budget Presentation Award to the City of Revere, Massachusetts for its annual budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and every year since. To receive this award, a governmental unit must publish a budget document that meets program criteria as a policy document, as an operations guide, as a financial plan, and as a communications device. The award is the highest form of recognition in governmental budgeting.

#### **Education Reform**

State legislation known as the Education Reform Act of 1993, as amended, imposes certain minimum expenditure requirements on municipalities with respect to funding for education and related programs, and may affect the level of state aid to be received for education. The requirements are determined on the basis of formulas affected by various measures of wealth and income, enrollments, prior levels of local spending and state aid, and other factors. Currently the City of Revere is in full compliance with the mandates of the Education Reform Act of 1993.

State Aid - In addition to grants for specified capital purposes (some of which are payable over the life of the bonds issued for the projects), the Commonwealth provides financial assistance to cities and towns for current purposes. Payments to cities and towns are derived primarily from a percentage of the State's personal income, sales and use, and corporate excise tax receipts, together with the net receipts from the State Lottery. A municipality's state aid entitlement is based on several different formulas, of which the "schools" and "lottery" formulas are the most important. Both major formulas tend to provide more state aid to poorer communities. The formulas for determining a municipality's state aid entitlement are subject to amendment by the state legislature and, while a formula might indicate that a particular amount of state aid is owed, the amount of state aid actually paid is limited to the amount appropriated by the state legislature. The state annually estimates state aid, but the actual state aid payments may vary from the estimate.

State School Building Assistance Program: Under its school building assistance program, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides grants to cities, towns and regional school districts for school construction projects. Until July 26, 2004, the State Board of Education was responsible for approving grants for school projects and otherwise administering the program. Grant amounts ranged from 50% to 90% of approved project costs. Municipalities generally issued bonds to finance the entire project cost, and the Commonwealth disbursed the grants in equal annual installments over the term of the related bonds.

Pursuant to legislation which became effective on July 26, 2004, the state legislature created the Massachusetts School Building Authority (the "Authority") to finance and administer the school building assistance program. The Authority has assumed all powers and obligations of the Board of Education with respect to the program. In addition to certain other amounts, the legislation dedicates a portion of Commonwealth sales tax receipts to the Authority to finance the program.

The range of reimbursement rates for new project grant applications submitted to the Authority on or after July 22, 2007 has been reduced to between 40% and 80% of approved project costs. The Authority promulgated new regulations with respect to the application and approval process for projects submitted after July 22, 2007. The Authority expects to pay grants for such projects as project costs are incurred pursuant to project funding agreements between the Authority and the municipalities. None of the interest expense incurred on debt issued by municipalities to finance their portion of the costs of new projects will be included in the approved project costs eligible for reimbursement.

Local Options Meals Tax: On May 24, 2010, the City adopted the local meals excise tax to be effective July 22, 2010. The local meals excise tax is a 0.75% tax on the gross receipts of a vendor from the sale of restaurant meals. The tax is paid by the vendor to the State Commissioner of Revenue, who in turn pays the tax to the municipality in which the meal was sold. In fiscal 2021, the City collected \$635,412 and the revenue from this tax.

Room Occupancy Tax: An additional source of revenue for the City is the room occupancy tax. Under the room occupancy tax, local governments may tax the provision of hotel, motel, lodging houses and bed and breakfast rooms at a rate not to exceed four percent of the cost of renting such rooms. The tax is paid by the operator of each establishment to the State Commissioner of Revenue, who in turn pays the tax back to the municipality in which the room is located. On August 10, 2009, the City increased this tax to 6% to be effective October 1, 2009. In fiscal 2021, the City collected \$548,001 from this tax.

Marijuana Excise Tax: In November 2016, voters of the Commonwealth approved a law legalizing and regulating the cultivation, manufacture, processing, distribution, sale, possession, testing and use of recreational marijuana, which was amended by the legislature in July 2017. The local adoption statute permits a municipality to impose an excise tax of up to 3% on local sales of marijuana and marijuana products by marijuana retailers operating within the community. The City approved a 3% local option excise on retail marijuana sales on March 19, 2018. The City has approved 1 medical dispensary license which includes retail and a cultivation facility. This facility is not yet open.

#### Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund

The City's Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund, created in 2001, is a single, full cost recovery fund. The costs have been transferred into the Enterprise Fund from the General Fund over several fiscal years, and rates have been increased accordingly per 100 cubic feet, most recently as follows:

| Water Rates |             |            | Sewer Rates |             |            |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Fiscal Year | Residential | Commercial | Fiscal Year | Residential | Commercial |
| 2021        | \$ 4.06     | \$ 6.73    | 2021        | \$ 12.25    | \$ 20.20   |
| 2020        | 3.91        | 6.48       | 2020        | 11.79       | 19.44      |
| 2019        | 4.01        | 6.51       | 2019        | 11.98       | 19.48      |
| 2018        | 4.01        | 6.37       | 2018        | 12.49       | 19.24      |
| 2017        | 3.75        | 5.93       | 2017        | 12.40       | 18.55      |

#### **Annual Audits**

The City's accounts are audited annually. The most recent completed audit was conducted by Powers and Sullivan for fiscal 2022.

#### Unassigned Fund Balance and Free Cash

The following table sets forth the trend in Unassigned General Fund balance and free cash as certified by the Bureau of Accounts.

| Year | Unassigned<br>General Fund<br>Balance |     | Free Cash<br>(July 1) |     |
|------|---------------------------------------|-----|-----------------------|-----|
| 2021 | \$ 11,997,789                         | (1) | \$ 2,000,000 (est.)   |     |
| 2020 | 16,608,558                            |     | 1,329,154             | (2) |
| 2019 | 19,362,385                            |     | 6,303,811             |     |
| 2018 | 19,560,123                            |     | 6,127,553             |     |
| 2017 | 20,165,252                            |     | 6,273,580             |     |
| 2016 | 16,854,365                            |     | 4,412,074             |     |

<sup>(1)</sup> Decrease attributable to minor operational drawdowns in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 as the City worked to address local unemployment conditions and absorbed revenue shortfalls in both local property and local hotel and meal excise taxes.

#### Stabilization Fund

The City maintains a Stabilization Fund, which is accounted for in the Trust Funds. Funded by appropriations, the Stabilization Fund plus interest income may be appropriated at any City Council meeting for any municipal purpose.

<sup>(2)</sup> The decrease in Free Cash is a direct result of the decreased local receipts due to the pandemic.

The trend in Stabilization Fund balance is as follows:

| Stabilization Fund Balances |              |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Fiscal<br>Year              | June 30      |
| 2021                        | \$ 8,990,923 |
| 2020                        | 8,557,300    |
| 2019                        | 8,472,452    |
| 2018                        | 7,386,312    |
| 2017                        | 6,445,276    |

The City has adopted a policy whereby 15% of land sale proceeds and 15% of annual certified free cash is annually appropriated into the Stabilization Fund.

#### Tax Increment Financing for Development Districts

Under recent legislation, cities and towns are authorized to establish development districts to encourage increased residential, industrial, and commercial activity. All or a portion of the taxes on growth in assessed value in such districts may be pledged and used solely to finance economic development projects pursuant to the city or town's development program for the district. This includes pledging such "tax increments" for the payment of bonds issued to finance such projects. As a result of any such pledge, tax increments raised from new growth properties in development districts are not available for other municipal purposes. Tax increments are considered in determining the total taxes assessed for the purpose of calculating the maximum permitted tax levy under Proposition 2½.

The City has not created any such districts.

#### Investment of City Funds

Investments of funds of cities and towns, except for trust funds, are generally restricted by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 44, §55. That statute permits investments of available revenue funds and bond and note proceeds in term deposits and certificates of deposits of banks and trust companies, in obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by the federal government or an agency thereof with a maturity of not more than one year, in repurchase agreements with a maturity of not more than 90 days secured by federal or federal agency securities, in participation units in the Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust ("MMDT"), or in shares in SEC-registered money market funds with the highest possible rating from at least one nationally recognized rating organization.

MMDT is an investment pool created by the Commonwealth. The State Treasurer is the sole trustee, and the funds are managed under contract by an investment firm under the supervision of the State Treasurer's office. According to the State Treasurer the Trust's investment policy is designed to maintain an average weighted maturity of 90 days or less and is limited to high-quality, readily marketable fixed income instruments, including U.S. Government obligations and highly rated corporate securities with maturities of one year or less.

Trust funds, unless otherwise provided by the donor, may be invested in accordance with §54 of Chapter 44, which permits a broader range of investments than §55, including any bonds or notes that are legal investments for savings banks in the Commonwealth. The restrictions imposed by §54 and §55 do not apply to city and town retirement systems.

#### RETIREMENT SYSTEM

The Massachusetts General Laws provide for the establishment of contributory retirement systems for state employees, for teachers and for county, city, and town employees other than teachers. Teachers are assigned to a separate statewide teachers' system and not to the city and town systems. For all employees other than teachers, this law is subject to acceptance in each city and town. Substantially all employees of an accepting city or town are covered. If a town has a population of less than 10,000 when it accepts the statute, its non-teacher employees participate through the county system and its share of the county cost is proportionate to the aggregate annual rate of regular compensation of its covered employees. In addition to the contributory systems, cities and towns provide non-contributory pensions to a limited number of employees, primarily persons who entered service prior to July 22, 1937, and their dependents. The Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission ("PERAC") provides oversight and guidance for and regulates all state and local retirement systems.

The obligations of a city or town, whether direct or through a county system, are contractual legal obligations and are required to be included in the annual tax levy. If a city or town, or the county system of which it is a member, has not established a retirement system funding schedule as described below, the city or town is required to provide for the payment of the portion of its current pension obligations which is not otherwise covered by employee contributions and investment income. "Excess earnings," or earnings on individual employees' retirement accounts more than a predetermined rate, are required to be set aside in a pension reserve fund for future, not current, pension liabilities. Cities and towns may voluntarily appropriate to their system's pension reserve fund in any given year up to five percent of the preceding year's tax levy. The aggregate amount in the fund may not exceed ten percent of the equalized valuation of the city or town.

If a city or town, or each member city and town of a county retirement system, has accepted the applicable law, it is required to annually appropriate an amount sufficient to pay not only its current pension obligations, but also a portion of its future pension liability. The portion of each such annual payment allocable to future pension obligations is required to be deposited in the pension reserve fund. The amount of the annual city or town appropriation for each such system is prescribed by a retirement system funding schedule which is periodically reviewed and approved by PERAC. Each system's retirement funding schedule is designed to reduce the unfunded actuarial pension liability of the system to zero by not later than June 30, 2030, with annual increases in the scheduled payment amounts of not more than 4.5 percent. The funding schedule must provide that payment in any year of the schedule is not less than 95 percent of the amount appropriated in the previous fiscal year. City, town, and county systems which have an approved retirement funding schedule receive annual pension funding grants from the Commonwealth for the first 16 years of such funding schedule. Pursuant to recent legislation, a system (other than the state employees' retirement system and the teachers' retirement system) which conducts an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2009, or later, may establish a revised schedule which reduces the unfunded actuarial liability to zero by not later than June 30, 2040, subject to certain conditions. If the schedule is so extended under such provisions and a later updated valuation allows for the development of a revised schedule with reduced payments, the revised schedule shall be adjusted to provide that the appropriation for each year shall not be less than that for such year under the prior schedule, thus providing for a shorter schedule rather than reduced payments. The City extended the amortization term to 2032.

City, town and county systems may choose to participate in the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund (the "PRIT Fund"), which receives additional state funds to offset future pension costs of participating state and local systems. If a local system participates in the PRIT Fund, it must transfer ownership and control of all

assets of its system to the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board, which manages the investment and reinvestment of the PRIT Fund. Cities and towns with systems participating in the PRIT Fund continue to be obligated to fund their pension obligations in the manner described above. The additional state appropriations to offset future pension liabilities of state and local systems participating in the PRIT Fund are required to total at least 1.3 percent of state payroll. Such additional state appropriations are deposited in the PRIT Fund and shared by all participating systems in proportion to their interests in the assets of the PRIT Fund as of July 1 for each fiscal year.

Cost-of-living increases for each local retirement system may be granted and funded only by the local system, and only if it has established a funding schedule. Those statutory provisions are subject to acceptance by the local retirement board and approval by the local legislative body, which acceptance may not be revoked.

The City contributes to the Revere Retirement System ("System"), a single employer, public employee retirement system that acts as the investment and administrative agent for the City. Public school teachers are covered by the Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System (MTRS) to which the City of Revere does not contribute. The System and the MTRS are contributory defined benefit plans covering all City employees and teachers deemed eligible.

Instituted in 1940, the System is a member of the Massachusetts Contributory System and is governed by Chapter 32 of the Massachusetts General Laws, as amended. Membership in the System is mandatory immediately upon the commencement of employment for all permanent, full-time employees. As of January 1, 2019, membership in the System consisted of:

| Retired members and survivors | 497   |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| Active employees              | 620   |
| Vested Terminated Members     | 11    |
| Total                         | 1,128 |

The system provides for retirement allowance benefits up to a maximum of 80% of a member's highest three-year average annual rate of regular compensation. Benefit payments are based upon a member's age, length of credible service, level of compensation and group classification.

As of January 1, 2019, the unfunded actuarial liability of the City's retirement system was \$108,612,300 assuming a 7.25% discount rate. The System's funding policy is governed by Section 22D of Chapter 32 of the Massachusetts General Laws. Accordingly, the minimum contribution the City is required to fund each year is the actuarially determined normal cost plus an amount to amortize the unfunded liability for retirees and active employees by June 30, 2033.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts currently reimburses the System on a semiannual basis for the portion of benefit payments owing to cost-of-living increases granted after the implementation of Proposition 2 ½, but prior to local acceptance of Chapter 17 of the Acts of 1997.

#### Other Post-Employment Benefits

In addition to pension benefits, cities and towns may provide retired employees with health care and life insurance benefits. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board ("GASB") Statement Nos. 43 and 45, require public sector entities to report the future costs of these non-pension, post-employment benefits in their financial statements. These accounting standards do not require pre-funding the payment of these costs as the liability for such costs accrues, but the basis applied by the standards for measurement of costs and liabilities for these benefits is conservative if they continue to be funded on a pay-as-you-go basis and will result in larger yearly cost and liability accruals than if the cost of such benefits were pre-funded in a trust fund in the same manner as traditional pension benefits. Cities and towns that choose to self-insure all or a portion of the cost of the health care benefits they provide to employees and retirees may establish a trust fund for the purpose of paying claims. In addition, cities and towns may establish a trust fund for the purpose of pre-funding other post-employment benefits liability in the same manner as traditional pension benefits.

The City was required to implement the GASB reporting requirements for other post-employment benefits beginning in fiscal year 2008. As of June 30, 2019, the total OPEB liability for benefits was \$288,098,848 and the fiduciary net position was \$504,144, resulting in a net OPEB liability of \$287,594,704, assuming a discount rate of 2.75%. The actuarial determined contribution (ADC) is an amount determined by the actuary pursuant to GASB Statement No. 74/75 which represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover the service cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the ADC was \$23,186,865.

The City adopted an OPEB liability trust in fiscal 2019. The City has since deposited money into the trust with a current balance of \$1,144,274 as of June 30, 2021. The City is working on dedicating revenue streams to fund annually as part of the fiscal 2022 budget and its financial policies within.

#### **EMPLOYEE RELATIONS**

City and town employees (other than managerial and confidential employees) are entitled to join unions and to bargain collectively on questions of wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment. Provisions for compulsory arbitration of labor disputes involving fire fighters and police officers were repealed by the initiative law adopted at the November 1980 election.

The following table sets forth the number of full-time employees in the City by major department:

| Department         | No. of Employees |

#### LITIGATION

At present there are various cases pending in either Suffolk District, Suffolk Superior, or U.S. District Court, where the City of Revere is a defendant. In the opinion of the City Solicitor, none of the pending litigation is likely to result, either individually or in the aggregate, in final judgments against the City that would materially affect its financial position.

# Mayoral Focus Areas

All departments across municipal government are asked to provide supplemental data along with their respective budget requests each year. As part of this process, each department is asked to submit goals for the coming fiscal year. These goals were to be commensurate with the Mayor's specific areas of focus and priorities including: providing equiable municipal resources and services, achieving a common goal, having a culture based on results, benefitting neighborhoods, fostering local economic development, and fiscal responsibility.

# City Wide Strategic Goals

#### Next Stop Revere: Executive Summary

*Next Stop Revere* is the city's first comprehensive master plan in more than four decades. The planning process comes at a critical point in Revere's history, as it seeks to build on its unique identity, location, and place in the region, in order to ensure that all residents can benefit from its growth and development.

The City of Revere partnered with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) to develop a set of actions for the City to take over the next fifteen to twenty years. The planning process built on several community planning initiatives over the past ten years and leveraged the data and insights gathered through each of those processes. Previous planning processes include:

The 2009 Shirley Ave. Neighborhood Gateway Initiative

The 2010 Community Health Assessment (MGH)

The 2013 Cultural Districts Initiative Application

The 2016 Revere Technical Assistance Panel Report

The 2017 Boston Amazon HQ2 Proposal

The 2018 Revere Open Space and Recreation Plan

The 2019 Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Program Assessment

Three key elements shape the past, present, and future of Revere. Revere's residents represent a mix of families who have called Revere home for generations as well as recently arrived immigrants from all over the world. Revere's location at the gateway to Greater Boston and the North Shore has increased its regional significance, while also presenting transportation, housing, and economic development opportunities and challenges. Recent interest from developers has provided benefits for Revere but has also presented challenges as the City seeks to provide the highest quality of life for its current and future residents.

#### Results of the Master Plan: Strategic Goals Developed

#### HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES

The Historic and Cultural Resources section of the Master Plan sets the context for both history and culture in Revere. It describes the history of Revere, the places, objects, and sites that have been recognized for their historic significance, and the organizations active in remembering and preserving Revere's history. It also identifies the arts and cultural events, enterprises, activities, and organizations active in Revere today, documenting the challenges and concerns related to equitable cultural preservation and enhancement. The following strategies are designed to strengthen preservation efforts and ensure the enhancement of cultural resources in Revere.

- Goal 1: Increase cultural equity and inclusion in Revere
- Goal 2: Improve access to historic resources and cultural facilities for all Revere residents
- Goal 3: Expand access to arts education for all Revere residents
- Goal 4: Increase funding for Revere's historic and cultural resources
- Goal 5: Preserve and celebrate Revere's historic legacy as a destination for culture and entertainment
- Goal 6: Improve pedestrian access to cultural resources

#### HOUSING

Revere has long been an affordable place to live that welcomes people from all walks of life. The metropolitan region has seen significant increases in housing costs in recent years, and with new investment and development, Revere is beginning to experience similar increases. This will provide new sources of revenue and expand the capacity of the City to serve its residents and address unmet housing need. While market-rate housing development brings many benefits, it also needs to be balanced with the addition of deed-restricted Affordable Housing that will help ensure the overall supply of new housing is affordable to all of Revere's residents and can help mitigate the impacts of an increasingly expensive market. A balanced approach will be important to maintain the diversity that makes Revere so unique and to ensuring that it continues to have a stable workforce as it continues to grow.

- Goal 1: Create new deed-restricted Affordable Housing and preserve existing deed-restricted Affordable Housing
- Goal 2: Mitigate displacement pressures and create greater housing stability for vulnerable residents
- Goal 3: Increase access to a variety of homeownership opportunities for moderate and low-income households (deed-restricted Affordable and market-rate condos, duplexes, and townhomes)
- Goal 4: Strengthen and expand the existing naturally affordable housing stock
- Goal 5: Help residents afford new market-rate housing

#### TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY

An affordable, well-connected, and safe transportation network is a critical component of a thriving and vibrant community and the backbone of a strong economy. Ensuring there are strong connections between homes, jobs, and services is fundamental to support residents' livelihood and promoting local job growth.

Revere is fortunate in that the city is served by three MBTA subway stations, twelve MBTA bus lines, and two MBTA commuter rail tracks (though no stations), as well as some pedestrian and cycling facilities, including the Northern Strand Trail and the waterfront side paths on Revere Beach Boulevard. It is also intersected by several heavily trafficked regional roadways and is located within a short distance of Logan International Airport in neighboring East Boston. However, the City is grappling with significant traffic issues, as well as major pedestrian and bicyclist safety concerns.

- Goal 1: Continue to prioritize transportation safety improvements at high crash corridors and intersections
- Goal 2: Continue to improve and expand on- and off-street walking and biking infrastructure in Revere
- Goal 3: Require new residential developments and new large employers to provide activities, incentives, and infrastructure improvements to encourage residents and visitors to travel by public transit, walking, and biking
- Goal 4: Consider modifying parking regulations to make sure parking spaces are being used efficiently and effectively in the downtown, on the waterfront, and in residential neighborhoods
- Goal 5: Continue to partner with the MBTA to bring improvements to the Blue Line, Commuter Rail, and local bus service
- Goal 6: Continue to work closely with MassDOT, DCR, and neighboring communities on highway projects on state-owned roadways in Revere
- Goal 7: Continue advocacy for regional transportation improvements to alleviate regional traffic congestion and minimize its local impacts

#### **ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT**

Planning for Revere's economic future requires an integrated assessment of the city's land-use policies, business composition, transportation infrastructure, social capital, and housing stock to leverage existing assets and find new opportunities. While Revere is planning for its economic future as an independent agent within the Boston metro region, the city also plays a role in the development of the region as a whole and has engaged in collaborative planning efforts with neighboring municipalities. Revere is now planning for its economic future within the Boston metro area, given its key location and role as a gateway city between Boston and the North Shore. Revere is home to two of the biggest transit-oriented development sites in the region, Wonderland and Suffolk Downs, which could bring a large influx of new commercial space to the city, in addition to a host of new residential units.

- Goal 1: Improve Revere residents' employment opportunities through workforce development programming and policies
- Goal 2: Support small business retention, growth, and expansion in Revere's commercial corridors (Broadway, Beachmont/Donnelly, Revere Beach, Revere Street, Shirley Avenue, Squire Road)
- Goal 3: Attract established businesses to Revere in the technology, scientific and innovation industries
- Goal 4: Support and expand job dense businesses in the industrial sectors (manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, construction, wholesale trade)
- Goal 5: Build local entrepreneurship models for home-based workers, consultants, food entrepreneurs, and local microenterprises

#### **OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION**

Open space and parks are critical to the quality of life in a community and provide a wide range of benefits. The environmental benefits provided by open space include water absorption and filtering, flood control, removal of carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the urban environment, habitat, and food for wildlife, and shade that mitigates the urban heat index. By providing opportunities for outdoor activity for all age groups in Revere, open space promotes healthy lifestyles. Outdoor opportunities include both active recreation, such as structured sports, running, biking, and hiking, as well as passive activities, such as bird watching, picnicking, and strolling. Public recreation areas and open space provide a setting for community life and promote a unique and identifiable community character.

- Goal 1: Implement the Master Plan consistent with the current Open Space and Recreation Plan
- Goal 2: Provide recreational opportunities for residents of all ages and abilities
- Goal 3: Develop facilities and programs that promote fitness and health
- Goal 4: Maintain, enhance, and maximize the quality of existing parks, playgrounds, trails, and recreation areas
- Goal 5: Coordinate with DCR and other state and regional entities that operate and maintain open spaces. Maintaining these critical partnerships provide a relational vehicle for open space and recreational opportunities to be realized
- Goal 6: Promote pocket park development on city-owned land in neighborhoods with limited park access, and where they can best provide climate resilience, social, and health benefits
- Goal 7: Encourage ongoing public education and direct sponsorship of pocket park development among civic, neighborhood, and business groups

# PUBLIC HEALTH

Population health is shaped by our collective exposures to healthy and unhealthy environments - it begins in our homes, in our children's schools, in the natural and built environment, and at our places of employment. Given the connection of our neighborhoods to our health, the Master Plan provides a framework for understanding how community conditions affect the health of Revere residents and identifies strategies to sustain healthy outcomes among residents, from childhood to later in life. Public health is deeply linked to other elements of *Next Stop Revere* by presenting new perspectives on how recommendations in other chapters of the Plan, such as Economic Development, Housing, Open Space, and Transportation, can contribute to healthier outcomes for residents.

- Goal 1: Create indoor and outdoor spaces, linked with programming, to strengthen community connectedness and promote physical activity and healthy eating among residents of all ages
- Goal 2: Use the built environment, policy, and programmatic interventions that improve and sustain the behavioral and mental health of all residents
- Goal 3: Address environmental exposures that affect the physical health of residents
- Goal 4: Prioritize healthy eating and active living investments to reduce the risk of acute, chronic disease, injury and premature mortality
- Goal 5: Assure a high performing municipal public health system that promotes the health and equity of residents in local decision-making, including decisions made by non-health sectors

# ENERGY AND CLIMATE

As a dense, urban, coastal city, Revere faces several challenges in terms of climate change impacts, including sea-level rise, storm surge, and coastal flooding, and the urban heat island effect. These risks put a strain on municipal services, strains wastewater systems, damage public property, and impact the health, safety, and welfare of residents and businesses. The City has already taken steps to plan for the impacts of climate change through the State's Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) program. Through this process, Revere identified climate vulnerabilities and created an action plan to begin to address priority projects. The Plan also summarizes municipal energy usage, energy across the community, and the City's successes to date related to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The goal of this planning effort is to continue to make Revere a more prepared and resilient place.

- Goal 1: Reduce energy use and GHG emissions across the community
- Goal 2: Increase access for residents, businesses and non-profits to clean energy for electricity and heating/cooling needs
- Goal 3: Ensure that built infrastructure is protected or adapted from natural hazards and climate change impacts
- Goal 4: Implement programs to increase education, awareness, and access to climate resilience for all community members, including those most vulnerable to climate change impacts

#### **PUBLIC FACILITIES & SERVICES**

In many ways, the character of our communities can be reflected in the quality and appearance of its civic facilities. The Master Plan helps to guide decisions and develop a plan relevant to public buildings, utilities, and infrastructure in order to meet future needs of the community. Public facilities make it possible for municipal employees and volunteers to provide services for the public good. The City's ability to provide adequate facilities depends on effective capital planning and a commitment to implementation, asset management policies, and the amount of revenue available for local government operations.

- Goal 1: Ensure adequate resources for Revere's public services
- Goal 2: Strengthen effective communication and collaboration within City government and with the public
- Goal 3: Ensure facilities and services meet community and departmental needs
- Goal 4: Promote sustainability in municipal operations and facilities
- Goal 5: Improve stewardship of public properties
- Goal 6: Explore new strategies for creating Public Facilities to gain more land and operational efficiencies

#### CONCLUSION

The Master Plan enabled the city to solicit feedback regarding areas that employees, citizens, and other stakeholders find important. The implementation of these goals is a multi-year undertaking. With that in mind, actions have already been taken to help achieve several important goals.

The city promotes its many diverse cultures through many kinds of events, from flag raisings at city hall, to cultural celebrations at the senior center, and within the schools. Renovations have occurred at the Historical Society building, with the goal to conduct more events and outreach to residents. Housing affordability continues to be challenging for the city, but the recently created Affordable Housing Trust Fund board has already begun allocating resources towards promoting affordable housing in new developments.

The Affordable Housing Trust Fund Board is using its resources to help address many, if not all, of the housing goals in the strategic plan. The trust is funded primarily through free cash appropriations. Primarily through the Mayor's Office and the Department of Planning and Community Development, transportation and mobility goals are being addressed throughout the city. In FY2023, many speed-calming measures were adopted, including installation of speed bumps in observed high-speed zones, solar-powered speed signs, and increased enforcement.

The city is working on building and improving several municipal buildings to ensure services are delivered in an efficient, modern manner. The new DPW building is slated to open this fall, showcasing a facility that can house the city's equipment, provide a central location for citizens to go to for their DPW-related needs, and provide employees with a safe, updated work area. The city is also working on renovating a former gym to create the Haas Wellness Center, which will provide residents with opportunities to improve upon their health and wellness.

The development of the master plan, and the steps taken to address the various goals, will help the city chart a course for the next several years, and help steer policy decisions that affect the population by prioritizing these areas which have been identified as high-priority to the residents.

## **Budget Process Overview**

The budget for the City of Revere has been developed based on projected revenue assumptions. The revenue assumptions are based on several factors, one of which is the budget ceiling or levy limit of revenue derived from local property taxes in accordance with Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 59 § 21C), which is a Massachusetts statute limiting property tax increases of Massachusetts municipalities by 2 ½ %. In 1980, it was passed by ballot measure, specifically called an initiative petition, within Massachusetts state law, and went into effect in 1982. Added to these revenues are projections for state aid and local aid, such as excise tax, fees, permits, interest earned and other available funds which can come from free cash or other special funds.

As you review the budget, you may notice that reporting formats have been streamlined. The intention is to provide the City Council, residents and interested parties with a more user friendly and comprehensive financial reporting tool, which encourages transparency and ownership by city departments.

The Mayor, his staff, and the Budget team, led by the City Auditor/Budget Director, meet with departments at various times during the fiscal year to introduce changes to the process and requesting updated departmental information such as accomplishments and goals. Departments were given the opportunity to align their goals with Mayoral Focus Areas and communicate budgetary needs.

The budget process typically begins early in October, with the goal of creating budget calendars, reviewing the prior fiscal year process, and identifying areas of reporting to be updated. In January, members of the budget team begin creating new budget templates and in February, departments are forwarded budget request forms and are asked to submit their budget requests and final versions of their supplemental data to the Mayor and Budget team by March.

During April, the Mayor, his staff, and City Auditor/Budget Director meet with every department head, including the Superintendent and Business Manager of schools, to discuss their budgets and capital improvement needs. These requests are then consolidated into formal recommendations and presented to the Mayor for inclusion in the budget.

Throughout April and May, the team reviews and evaluates departmental requests and projected state & local aid revenues. All information is reviewed carefully for accuracy and consistency to ensure the proposed budget contains information that was complete and accurate in order for the City Council to make an informed decision regarding the finances of the City of Revere.

As State Aid estimates are made available, the budget is evaluated and amended accordingly, up until the submission to the City Council. State Aid estimates are based on the Senate Final Budget proposal available at the time the budget was submitted for presentation to the City Council.

During the month of June, the City Council Ways and Means subcommittee meets with department heads to review each departmental budget submission and the Mayor's recommendations. Budget hearings are posted per open meeting laws, and broadcast on local television as well as YouTube. Department heads have the opportunity to present their budget as well as any special needs or accomplishments worth highlighting, and

anyone is able to attend and comment on the budgets as presented. Upon completion of this process, the City Council approves the final budget for the forthcoming fiscal year.

Upon adoption of the budget and prior to setting the City tax rate for the fiscal year, the Mayor may submit to the City Council all his/her recommendations for supplemental appropriations, which are deemed necessary, by the Mayor, for the operation of city government for the fiscal year, excluding appropriations requested by the Mayor from time to time by means of transfer. Transfers are provided for by Section 33B of Chapter 44 of the Massachusetts General Laws. These amendment procedures are governed notwithstanding any contrary provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws or Special Acts.

# Five Year Financial Forecast - Narrative

# FY2024 through FY2028

#### **Executive Summary**

The five-year financial forecast for the City of Revere is used as a budget tool that enables municipal officials to review operating needs, identify fiscal challenges and opportunities, and help develop long-term budgeting policies as part of an overall strategic plan. The five-year financial forecast is invaluable in identifying key areas that the City needs to focus on, such as rising health insurance costs, retirement assessments, and collective bargaining agreements. It also helps the City plan for its capital budget, debt service management, and long-term sustainability.

Financial forecasting is the process of projecting revenues and expenditures over a multi-year period. Factors that affect forecasting are current and future economic conditions, collective bargaining agreements, future operating and capital scenarios, and other factors that affect future revenues and expenditures.

The five-year financial forecast is also used as a communication tool for both the City Council and the public. The forecast is always evolving and is constantly updated as information becomes available.

The FY2025 budget reflects a commitment to professionalizing government as well as making strategic investments in public safety, public works, and public education. The budget also continues to follow the capital budget of the City, making significant investments in our public infrastructure and departmental equipment.

The FY2025 budget is balanced, with approximately \$295.1 million of estimated receipts to balance the general operating budget, general school operating budget and enterprise fund budgets. Below is a breakdown of all revenues and expenses as detailed in this forecast.

## <u>Revenues</u>

#### Tax Levy: \$120,297,649

The tax levy is the City's primary revenue source, comprising approximately 46.2% of the City's total general fund revenues. Residential property values pay 75.74% of the total property taxes, while commercial, industrial, and personal property values pay 24.26%. The City has a split tax rate which translates to a residential rate of \$9.07/m and a commercial rate of \$18.05/m for FY2025.

The City realizes an automatic 2.5% increase to the tax levy under Proposition 2 ½, plus any increase due to "new growth" in the City. New growth includes new development, condominium conversions, and renovations/expansions to existing properties, to name a few. Based upon data presented by the Chairperson of the Board of Assessors, new growth for the City for FY202 is estimated to be \$3.7m.

New growth estimated for fiscal years 2026 through 2028 are estimated using calculations presented by the Board of Assessors based upon reasonable estimates of typical new growth, as well as estimated construction schedules for some of the larger projects in the City, including Suffolk Downs, Revere Beach, and other larger developments in the pipeline. For FY2025, the forecast accounts for three types of new growth: typical new growth, new growth from the Suffolk Downs/HYM development, and new growth from other larger, atypical developments in the City.

#### <u>Local Receipts</u>: \$22,025,000

Local receipts are locally generated revenues other than real and personal property taxes. Examples include motor vehicle excise, investment income, hotel/motel tax, fees, rentals, and charges. The city has increased its estimate for local receipts by 4.14% for FY2025 (from \$21.2 to \$22.0) due to an anticipated increase in motor vehicle and rooms excise receipts.

Various local receipts have been increased and decreased to reflect historic performance as well as the anticipated economic effects. For example, room excise has been increased by \$500k due to the economic rebound post pandemic. Local receipts are expected to grow at various levels as indicated in the five-year financial forecast, with an overall growth of approximately 2-3% per year in total. Conservative estimates are what allow the city to maintain a healthy fund balance as well as to generate free cash once the books are closed each fiscal year.

# Cherry Sheet Revenue (State Aid): \$117,730,927

Named for the cherry-colored paper on which it was originally printed, the Cherry Sheet is the official notification by the Commissioner of Revenue to municipalities and regional school districts of estimated state aid to be paid and charges to be assessed over the next fiscal year. Cherry Sheets are usually issued each spring, following enactment by the Legislature of the state budget for the following year.

This year's budget continues the funding schedules in the 2019 Student Opportunity Act (SOA). The Governor's Chapter 70 appropriation will fully fund the Student Opportunity Act's seven-year plan for K-12 education. Most of the funds would implement the improvements to the foundation budget, adding weight for low-income students, English Language Learners, special education costs and school employee health benefits. As a result, Chapter 70 revenues increased by \$3.8 million or 3.84%. Cherry sheet revenue increased overall by 3.26%.

Also, Unrestricted General Government Aid (UGGA) is budgeted to increase at the same rate as projected growth of state revenues: 3.0%. The implementation of this state-local revenue sharing framework is good news to the City.

It is always difficult to gauge the amount that the Commonwealth will allocate to the 351 municipalities due to the volatile economy and evolving funding formulas. Nevertheless, we need to assume a figure for the purpose of completing the five-year financial forecast. Therefore, it is predicted that State Aid will increase by 4% from FY2026 through FY2028. This increase is conservative with the hope that the increase will be larger as the State continues to fund the Student Opportunity Act.

# Enterprise Fund Revenue: \$35,081,502

An enterprise fund, authorized by MGL Chapter 44, Section 53F ½, is a separate accounting and financial reporting mechanism for municipal services for which a fee is charged in exchange for goods or services. It allows a community to demonstrate to the public the portion of total costs of a service that is recovered through user charges and the portion that is subsidized by the tax levy, if any.

The City of Revere currently has two Enterprise Funds: Water and Sewer Enterprise and Solid Waste Enterprise.

#### Water/Sewer Enterprise: \$34,741,502

The Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund provides for full cost recovery including indirect costs that are appropriated in the general fund. Water and sewer enterprise fund revenues are estimated to have various increases over the next three fiscal years depending on the costs of assessments from the MWRA, as well as the debt service from some of the major projects underway in the City, which includes the completion of lead service replacement projects, the reconstruction of several water mains, rehabilitation of the sewer lines, and the consent decree infrastructure improvements.

For FY2025, the water and sewer rates increased by 4.25% as proposed by the former mayor and agreed to by the city council. This is the final year of a three-year rate structure. Other funding sources are used to help stabilize an otherwise significantly larger rate increase that would be necessary to cover the fixed costs of debt service and MWRA assessments. This includes using \$2 million from the water and sewer stabilization fund and \$500,000 in ARPA revenue replacement.

The city will have to do a comprehensive water/rate review to set rates for FY2026 and beyond to ensure that user fees and other department revenue of the water and sewer department will keep up with the rising costs of debt service and MWRA assessments. Placeholders are in the forecast for the estimated revenues that the city will need to generate to cover all direct and indirect costs. The city's CFO will be collaborating closely with the Superintendent of Public Works to review all statistical data on usage to craft new rates for FY2026 and beyond.

## Solid Waste/Recycling Enterprise: \$340,000

As stated above, an enterprise fund is a separate accounting and financial reporting mechanism for municipal services for which a fee is charged in exchange for goods or services. It allows a community to demonstrate to the public the portion of total costs of a service that is recovered through user charges and the portion that is subsidized by the tax levy, if any.

In the case of collecting and disposing of the City's solid waste and recycling, there is a significant subsidy from the City's general fund to the enterprise fund. In fact, only \$340,000 in projected revenues will offset the \$4.8 million cost of providing the service. The modified trash collection ordinance that was recently passed will help increase anticipated revenues by allowing for the enforcement of improper use of trash receptacles through the City's 40U health violation program. The City is in the second year of a three-year contract for trash and recycling collection, and has recently agreed to a ten (10) year contract with Win Waste for disposal of our solid waste and yard waste. The new contract provides long-term

stability to the city, as well as allowing for free yard waste removal for the next several years. Further, Win Waste has agreed to donate \$25,000 per year toward the city's initiative to provide composting to its residents. Members of the Planning Department and Public Works Department will soon be formalizing a policy to roll out this program.

It is estimated that the city will collect \$340,000 in revenues from the sale of commercial barrels, overflow barrels and recycle bins, as well as fines for improperly stored trash and recycling violations. For FY2026 through FY2028, it is estimated that the solid waste enterprise revenues will increase by 3%.

# **Expenses**

# General Government: \$10,705,999

Departments under General Government include all the financial offices and overhead support functions, including Mayor, City Council, Finance, Legal, City Clerk, Elections, Planning and Community Development.

General government spending for FY2025 is scheduled to increase by approximately \$1.4 million. This is primarily attributable to the funding of a salary reserve account for \$1 million for funding future Collective Bargaining Agreements that the city is currently negotiating with its respective unions.

Human Resources has been restructured in order to offer streamlined services both to employees and residents. In addition to the three FTEs from prior year, we have collapsed resources and employees from Talent and Culture, which includes DEI, language access, and the Revere Community School. This has resulted in one less FTE from FY2024, but an increased efficiency in providing services.

The Office of Constituent Services (311) has undergone a similar reorganization. This reorganization consolidated the Consumer Affairs office into 311, and moved the previously ARPA-funded Community Liaisons into the Public Health department. This restructuring resulted in 4 fewer FTEs in this department. Additionally, the IT department acquired the Data Analyst position, as well as adding a Help Desk Analyst to assist with the volume of requests the department handles.

We are also reducing our reliance on ARPA funds to supplement staffing. In FY2025, we have used ARPA funds for eight full FTE's and seven half-funded positions, down from twenty fully ARPA funded positions in the FY2024 budget. Some positions have been moved over to the general fund appropriation, while others have been funded by other funding sources, such as grants.

For forecasting purposes, the estimated expense increase for general government services for the City will be 3.5% for FY2026 through FY2028.

# Public Safety: \$32,810,322

Departments under Public Safety include Police, Fire, Regional Emergency Communications Center, Municipal Inspections, Building Commissioner, and Parking Departments.

In FY2025, Public Safety is budgeted at a 5.6% increase in spending. Some of the increase is due to additional staffing of uniformed police officers (2 FTE's) and fire fighters (2 FTE's). With the imminent opening of an additional fire station at the Point of Pines, we are looking ahead to ensure adequate staffing. Additionally, the Police Department's grant funded Behavioral Health Unit (BHU) remains funded through grants (two civilian FTE's and other related costs).

The budget for the City's apportionment of the Metro North Regional Emergency Call Center (MNRECC) has increased by approximately 4.4% (approx. \$70k), due to settling a long-term contract with the call takers that aligns their compensation with comparable emergency call centers. The budget allocation model for the MNRECC is developed using two components: population and call volume.

For the other public safety departments, Municipal Inspections added an additional FTE, which is funded through other funding sources. All other expenses remained level funded, apart from contractual raises.

The estimated expense increase for public safety for the city will be 4.0% for FY2026 through FY2028. These projected increases are due to the Mayor's commitment to maintain the staffing levels of its public safety departments, as well as a commitment to continue to fund the Metro North Regional Emergency Communication Center (911) for the benefit of the City and its residents. The 4.0% increase maintains current staffing levels in all public safety departments, and the addition of any additional full-time equivalent (FTE) employees will increase costs above the anticipated 4%. The administration and the Police and Fire unions continue to work collaboratively to address staffing issues to ensure that growth in these departments keeps up with the growth of the city and its population.

# Department of Public Works: \$4,862,822

Departments under Public Works (DPW) include Public Works Administration, Snow and Ice Removal, Highway, Open Space/Parks, and Facilities/Public Property. The Water, Sewer, and Drain (W/S/D) department and the Solid Waste department are also part of the DPW but are budgeted separately as enterprise funds.

Enterprise Fund accounting allows the City to treat the collection of its solid waste, recyclables, yard waste, and bulky items in a separate account that segregates revenues and expenses in the same manner as the Water/Sewer Enterprise Fund. While revenues of the Solid Waste Enterprise Fund do not cover the total cost of expenses incurred, as they do in the W/S/D Enterprise Fund, it does allow for identifying the true costs to the City for solid waste and recycling operations.

In FY2024, the Mayor hired a new Superintendent of Public Works to coordinate the departments of the DPW Administration, Highway, Parks/ Open Space, Facilities/ Public Property, Engineering, Water/ Sewer/ Drain, and Solid Waste. Impact bargaining with the unions has allowed for more

versatility in the way services are provided. Non payroll expenses for the FY2025 DPW departments have been mostly level funded, while salaries increase per the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. The hiring of a mechanic to service DPW vehicles and equipment will help the city save money on costly repairs done by outside vendors, and the creation of a DPW yard manager will ensure that our new \$25.6 million-dollar DPW facility will be maintained, and all inventory will be tracked and managed.

The FY2025 budget has increased 3.74% or \$174K. Estimated expense increases for the Department of Public Works are forecasted to increase 3.5% per year from FY2026 through FY2028.

# Health and Human Services: \$2,433,149

Departments under Human Services include the Public Health Department (Board of Health, Public Health and School Nurses, Community Outreach, and Substance Use and Homeless Initiatives departments), Elder Affairs, Veterans Affairs, Commission on Disability, and the Human Rights Commission (HRC). The role of the HRC is to protect the civil and human rights of both residents and visitors of the city. The pandemic has highlighted several areas of concern that the Mayor wishes to focus on to help improve the quality of life for city residents. To help address the concerns and improve upon these areas, several changes were made within Health and Human Services.

The Public Health Division has seen a reduction of 2.18 FTE's in FY2025. This is attributed to a department reorganization, where the Consumer Affairs office was incorporated into Constituent Services, and one school nurse being funded through the School Department.

The overall budget of all departments of the City's Health and Human Services has decreased by \$90k for FY2025, or 3.59%. These savings are a result of merging our Consumer Affairs Department from Health and Human Services to General Government under the supervision of the city's 311 department and well as efficiencies realized when we combined Community Outreach and Substance Abuse and Homeless Initiatives into the Health Department, creating a streamlined organizational structure that removed duplications of effort and created efficiencies in the overall delivery of services.

Estimated costs to Health and Human Services are expected to increase by 3.5% per year from FY2026 through FY2028.

# Cultural and Recreation: \$2,128,484

Departments under Cultural and Recreation include the Library, Parks & Recreation, Historical & Cultural Resources, as well as the newly established Department of Workforce Development and Youth Engagement.

Expenses in the Library Department are projected to increase by 6.1% for FY2025 due to the continued effort to expand programming to better fit the demands of its patrons. Certain requirements of the Commonwealth require the budget of the library to be funded at a level to meet its minimum appropriation requirement. The budget set forth in FY2025 allows for such funding.

The Library Director continues to give the library new energy, and it is noticeable when entering the library. Outdated, damaged, or otherwise unused materials have been purged and replaced with newer materials to better serve those residents who utilize the library. New virtual programs have been created, including a writing contest to engage the youth. Physical repairs to the library, including the main reading room and repairs to the roof, continue to be made, and the purchase of a new book mobile for the library will allow for expanded programming throughout the city once delivered.

Part of the Human Resources reorganization included the creation of the Department of Workforce Development, Labor Relations, and Youth Engagement. This department consists of two FTEs, and is mostly grant funded. The Department supports organizations, private sector businesses, public, private, non-profit granting agencies and foundations, and other external resources, with the goal of establishing and expanding the workforce development in the City of Revere.

With the opening of the Haas Health & Wellness Center in FY2024, the Parks and Recreation department continues to evolve. In addition to continuing its regular programming for various age groups, the department is growing its presence through social media, and offering a wide range of programming to appeal to a broad range of residents.

Estimated costs to Cultural and Recreation are expected to increase by 4.0% from FY2026 through FY2028 for purposes of forecasting.

# Fixed Costs: \$46,120,481

Fixed costs are costs that are legally or contractually mandated such as debt service, health insurance, retirement assessment, Medicare, and property/casualty insurance. Fixed costs continue to be the biggest challenge in municipal budgets. Each fixed cost has its own projected increase over the five-year forecast, which reflects estimated average costs municipalities are seeing in each category.

The projected increases for FY2026 through FY2028 for each fixed cost are as follows:

- Health Insurance: 6.0%
  - o In FY2025, the City will see an increase of 4.07% due to the natural increase in health care costs combined with the budgeted additional staffing in school and city departments during FY2025.
  - o The City, to achieve cost savings, implemented an "Opt-Out" program which will compensate employees who are able to come off the City's health insurance plans. This program will help reduce the head count of our employees who take the health care benefit and therefore reduce costs of providing health insurance.
  - o The increased costs of health insurance city-wide is something that the administration addressed with the public employee committee (PEC), a group of representatives of all the City's collective bargaining units, as well as a representative on behalf of the retirees.

- A new nine (9) year deal has been negotiated with the PEC to maintain the current plan design for the next nine years while agreeing to have active members and retirees to contribute a larger portion of the total costs in phases.
- For FY2025-FY2027, the HMO split for actives will increase from 20/80 (employee/employer) to 22.5/77.5 (ee/er)
- For FY2028-FY2030 the HMO split for actives will increase from 22.5/77.5 (ee/er) to 25/75 (ee/er)
- For FY2031-FY2044, the HMO and PPO split will increase from 25/75 (ee/er) to 27.5/72.5 (ee/er) and retiree Medex plans will increase from 25/75 (retiree/er) to 30/70 (retiree/er) for all new retirees only, where those retirees prior to this date will keep their lower contribution rates.
- o This newly negotiated agreement will not only help the overall financial stability to the City but will also help drastically reduce the City's unfunded "other post-employment benefits" obligations, which currently is \$288 million as of the city's last actuarial valuation. All while maintaining top-shelf health benefit plans for all the city's active and retired employees.
- Retirement Assessment: Per amortization schedule
  - o Estimated increases are needed to fully fund the unfunded liability by 2033. After 2033, the City will pay its normal costs.
  - o The city has received updated actuarial valuation of their retirement system as of January 1, 2023, and rolled forward to December 31, 2023.
  - o The actuarial accrued liability is approximately \$332.8 million with an actuarial value of assets of \$247.3 million.
  - o The difference of \$97.5 million represents the unfunded actuarial liability.
  - o The funded ratio is 71.7% as of December 31, 2023.
  - o The Revere retirement board has voted on a modified funding schedule that will increase by 5% each year until FY 2033.
  - o After FY2033, the Revere retirement system will then only need to fund its annual normal costs, decreasing the annual appropriation by approximately \$16M per year.
    - It is anticipated that once the system is fully funded, the excess savings will be spread between debt service costs of the new High School as well as increased funding to the city's other post-employment benefits (OPEB) Trust Fund.
- Medicare: 4.0%
  - o Estimated average salary increase over the next three years.
- Municipal Insurance: 5.0%
  - o Estimate based upon increased investments in the City's capital and infrastructure and normal inflationary costs.
- Debt service: Per estimated funding schedule
  - o The City's capital plan is an evolving document and will always adjust based upon the needs of the community, current market conditions, and changing circumstances of both the schools and general government operations.
  - o The FY2025 Debt Schedule reflects three major construction projects in process: the new Revere High School, the new Northeast Vocational School, and the new Point of Pines Fire Station
  - o The FY 2025 debt schedule also reflects the debt service for the eminent domain taking of Wonderland at \$29.5M.
  - o The City will be working in FY2025 to address future capital needs, assessing the costs of each project on the long-range capital plan, and forecasting out the anticipated debt service costs.

# Education - Revere School District: \$126,284,616

The School Committee oversees the budget process for the schools, and it has a bottom-line budget of \$126.3m for FY2025, an increase of 3.76% from FY2024 (\$121.7m). The school department's budget has been built on Chapter 70 estimates that are in line with the five-year financial forecast.

The FY2025 Governor's budget continues to fund the Student Opportunity Act (SOA). The funding of the SOA implements the recommendations of the 2015 Foundation Budget Review Commission which increases foundation budget levels for those communities with English Language Learners (ELL) and low-income students. As required by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), the City is required to fund an amount that meets the foundation budget and the net school spending requirement. Since the City typically funds the budget at this level, the amount above cannot be reduced without the risk of not complying with DESE regulations.

For financial forecasting purposes, we forecast that the cost of education will increase the general fund budget by 4-6% per year depending on the subcategory of the school department's budget. However, the overall cost may far exceed this estimate. It is most likely to be offset with an increase of Chapter 70 funding from the State, which will offset the additional increase on the revenue side of the forecast through the Cherry Sheet estimated revenue.

Please see the school department's section of the budget for additional information about the school's overall budget and the details of such.

# <u>Education</u> – Northeast Vocational: \$3,285,660

Revere's assessment for FY2025 increased by 43.2%, primarily due to increased debt service costs as it relates to the construction of the new Northeast Vocational High School. The costs associated with the new building project have begun with short-term debt costs averaging approximately 340K for FY 2023 and FY 2024 that have ramped up to \$1.1 million for FY2025 and expected to max out at \$1.75 million once construction is completed. These estimated debt service costs are forecasted as part of the total costs of the assessment from the Voc.

For FY2025 and beyond, debt service budget is apportioned cost of the forecasted debt service payments come from the Voc debt schedule. For general operating costs of the Northeast Vocational School, we are projecting a 4% increase for FY2026 through FY2028.

# Enterprise Fund Expenses - Water/Sewer/Drain (W/S/D) Enterprise: \$31,742,531

Expenses in this enterprise fund represent personnel, expenses, contracted services, assessments, and debt service costs. The main drivers of the almost 2.0% increase in FY2024 were due to increases in fixed costs for water and sewer debt principal and interest payments.

To be more efficient and effective, all services that are done within these departments are examined and modified as needed. Impact bargaining with the unions has allowed for more versatility in the way services are provided. In many of these cases, the purchases of equipment over the past several years have allowed the W/S/D department to do more work in-house, thereby saving money on contracted services. These efficiencies have benefitted the costs on labor and expenses; however, it is the debt service and MWRA assessments that drive the costs. These costs represent over 90% of the overall costs of the operating budget (not including indirect costs).

## Expenses Projection

Expenses are projected to rise from FY2026-FY2028 as follows:

- Water/Sewer Enterprise
  - Personnel: 3.5%
  - Expenses: 3.5%
  - MWRA Assessment - Water: 5.0%
  - MWRA Assessment - Sewer: 5.0%
  - SRF Fees: projected debt schedule.
  - Debt Service: projected debt schedule.

## Enterprise Fund Expenses - Solid Waste/Recycling Disposal \$4,827,700

Expenses in the Solid Waste Enterprise fund consist of salary and expenses, as well as contracted services for the collection and disposal of the City's solid waste and recycling.

The City has an agreement on a contract with Capitol Waste that expires in FY2026, as well as a new ten (10) year contract with Win Waste, which will provide long-term stability for the city for disposal costs.

### For FY2026 and beyond, the City is forecasting increases in Solid Waste/Recycling costs as follows:

- Solid Waste Enterprise
  - Salary: 3.5%
  - Expenses: 3.5%
  - Contracted Services (including):
    - Solid Waste Pick up 3.5%
    - Solid Waste Disposal 3.5%
    - Recycling Disposal 3.5%

# Cherry Sheet Assessment: \$18,623,724

Named for the cherry-colored paper on which it was originally printed, the Cherry Sheet is the official notification by the Commissioner of Revenue to municipalities and regional school districts of estimated state aid to be paid and charges to be assessed over the next fiscal year. Cherry Sheets are usually issued each spring, following enactment by the Legislature of the state budget for the following year.

The categories of charges include state assessments (retired teachers' insurance, mosquito control, RMV non-renewal surcharge, etc.), transportation authorities (MBTA primarily), annual charges (special education), and tuition assessments (school choice and charter schools). This year's overall assessments have increased by \$.4 million from last year's assessment of \$18,244,210. Most of this increase is related to modest increases of charter school sending tuition (2.5%) from \$11.3 million to \$11.6 million and MBTA assessment (1.8%) from \$4.3 million to \$4.4 million.

It is projected that the Cherry Sheet assessment from the Commonwealth will increase 4% from FY2026 to FY2028.

# Other Expenditures: \$2,063,066

- Overlay: \$1,655,572
  - Overlay is an account established annually to fund anticipated property tax abatements and statutory exemptions adopted by the Council.
  - o Overlay is projected to increase 5.0% per year for the purpose of forecasting.
- Cherry Sheet Offset: \$157,494
  - o Offset receipts are receipts from the Cherry Sheet that are to be used for a specific purpose (public library). These obligations are expected to increase 4% from FY2026 to FY2028.
- Snow and Ice Deficit: \$0
  - o The city covered the FY 2024 snow and ice deficit through a free cash appropriation at year end, which resulted in a zero budget for the FY2025 forecast. As a precautionary measure, the city has estimated a \$500k deficit for FY2026, with 5% increases per year for FY2027 and beyond.

### Conclusion

The five-year financial forecast is a tool that helps us best manage the challenges of such events. It is a tool that uses reasonable estimates in both revenue and expenditure trends while considering the overall economic picture of the current times. It has flexibility to adapt as needed, and consistently evolves as economic trends and other extraordinary and unforeseen events happen. The goal is to project revenues and expenditures up to five years into the future which helps the administration analyze where current trends are leading and estimate if money will be available for discretionary spending such as capital purchases, collective bargaining settlements, and new municipal program. It also will help identify those "budget buster" items that need reform from the local or state government.

With the anticipated approval of funding for a new high school, we will need to expand the five-year forecast to a ten (10) year forecast to account for the long-term planning of such. As of the timing of this forecast, the school building committee has approved the site of the former Wonderland Dog Track as a location of the new high school, and the city has approved the construction on the site. The city is now in the process of design and development of the high school as well as complying with all the compliance issues for soils and environmental issues through the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency (MEPA). It is anticipated that the new high school construction costs will be \$493.2 million, with an anticipated net reimbursement rate from the Massachusetts Building Authority of 48.4%. This would result in net debt service of \$254.4 million, with the full cost of debt service anticipated by FY2031.

This is the main reason that we will expand upon the forecast in FY2026, once these figures become more of a reality and a timeline for construction and anticipated occupancy is developed. In conclusion, the five-year forecast, combined with the capital improvement program and FY2025 budget, will continue to be the basis for all future financial planning for the City of Revere.

# FY 2025 Budget - Total FTE's by Department

Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) definition: FTE is a unit of measurement that indicates the workload of an employee. A full-time position, which in the City of Revere could be either 39 or 40 hours per week depending on the position, is equivalent to 1 FTE. Partial FTEs are calculated based on the hours worked versus the hours considered full-time (either 39 or 40 hours per week). Part time employees that receive no health or retirement benefits are not included in FTE count.

The FTE count below includes all regular, benefit eligible City employees, regardless of funding status. Some positions are fully or partially funded through grants or other non-General Fund funding sources.

- Chief Callahan was awarded the Patriot Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) and the Department of Defense for his unwavering support of officers that are serving in the National Guard and that may assistance during times of military activation and deployment.
- The department created a Behavioral Health Unit (BHU) and hired four civilian positions; a public safety case worker, a program coordinator and two behavioral health clinicians. The BHU has an officer assigned full-time and several officers that work on a part-time basis to work with the BHU staff in a collaborative effort to provide outreach and services to high utilizers or

persons having significant mental health issues. The clinician is a licensed social worker that can evaluate, assess and Section 12 individuals when necessary and appropriate. The department has purchased case management software called Apricot Solutions, to collect and evaluate data and record all interactions. The EAPS grant has also purchased four licenses of Rosetta Stone to learn another language for the BHU and RPD units. Our goal is to close the gap for when interacting with those whose language is not English. The unit is in the process of purchasing a software called CIMS, Critical Incident Management System which has a unique feature for the BHU to send reports and share data with other cities and towns in MA. In the current fiscal year from July 2023 to March 2024, the BHU attempted to assist 208 clients, 110 of which accepted resources provided. Resources and

![](_page_187_Picture_7.jpeg)

- The department continued to utilize funding from Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG). The grant will assist the Domestic Violence Unit by utilizing funding to expand and enhance domestic violence services to include officer overtime for additional outreach, training, to conduct follow-ups, attend community meetings, conduct educational sessions about domestic violence and promote where those in need can obtain services. Officers may also provide victims with transportation to court, to a shelter or another safe place. Funds will be used to purchase domestic violence related educational materials, brochures and will allow officers to attend additional training and equipment for the Domestic Violence Unit. Members of Domestic Violence also attended training through DOVE, INC's Spring 2024 Domestic Violence Awareness. DOVE partners with diverse communities, families, and individuals impacted by domestic violence.
- The department used Justice Assistance Grant Funds (JAG) for Re-wire training offered by ROCA. Re-wire training introduces law enforcement to the basic brain science, the impact of trauma on the brain and how it affects behaviors and lifelong patterns. The training will help officers understand how thoughts, feelings, and behaviors impact their work and lives. This training is approved by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Massachusetts Police Training Committee (MPTC).
- The department utilized funds from a community mitigation grant to add an additional 7 crime prevention cameras.
- The department supported and worked collaboratively with our city partners from Revere Health and Human Services, to open a warming station, located in the lower level of Revere City Hall for those that may be unsheltered or residents that lose their power/heat during inclement weather. Many evenings, the warming station was at capacity with people seeking shelter for the night.
- Last fiscal year, the police department entered in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement for the Regional Lock-Up Program with the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department (SCSD) to house non-bailable prisoners at SCSD's facilities for short term

detentions. Due to the overwhelming success of entering this agreement, the department has extended the agreement and will continue to work collaboratively with SCSD to house and detain prisoners. This program has dramatically reduced potential liability to the city and the police department.

- The department continues to review and update our policies and procedures, moving towards Certification and Accreditation. The Certification Program currently consists of 159 standards, all of which are mandatory. The 159 standards for certification are part of the 257 mandatory standards for Accreditation. Certification is a significant milestone towards achieving Accreditation.
- The department continues to utilize and upgrade digital technology to assist in the identification and prosecution of people who commit crimes in our city. Detectives continue to document and preserve digital evidence. Each detective in the Criminal Investigation/Major Crimes Unit uses the newest technology such as iPhones and software to photograph crime scenes and immediately submit pictures as evidence. This will dramatically aid detectives in capturing, documenting and preserving on-scene evidence that may be at substantial risk of being lost or destroyed. The software provides a usable database to preserve, cache and share digital evidence. Now, digital media accounts for a large amount of evidence collected to solve and prosecute cases. This software provides an option for victims or witnesses to have the ability to directly submit any form of digital evidence to the police department.

![](_page_189_Picture_3.jpeg)

- The department upgraded the software used to monitor and review crime prevention cameras, which have been strategically placed throughout the city. The software provides a better viewing capacity and these upgrades have also allowed the department to increase the storage capacity of all city cameras as the retention capacity has become increasingly reduced due to infrastructure issues.
- The department installed a large screen television in the public lobby of the police station to better display and inform citizens of registered sex offenders residing in the city. This system replaced the outdated bulletin board type display.
- The department purchased and implemented a new endpoint computer software protection system that is designed to quickly detect, analyze, block and contain cyber-attacks in progress. The software will protect the department (sensitive data) and the computer network from today's ever increasing threats of ransomware, malware and viruses. This endpoint computer software will strengthen and protect the police department's computer network and cyber infrastructure from security threats and attack. Recently, several area municipal departments, to include police departments, were attacked by an elaborate

- ransomware/malware. The computer systems/networks were successfully compromised and hacked. The RPD computer software protection system was able to defeat the immediate threat to the network and protect our intricate computer system.
- The department continues to conduct additional in-service training by Law Enforcement Dimensions, Attorney John Scheft, that is designed for supervisors, especially how to deal with complex and challenging issues involved persons having a mental health crisis, along with how to properly navigate mental health evaluation that involve Section 12 and Section 35 matters. There were several additional components specifically for supervisors that focused on use of force, proportionate use of force, duty to intervene, and essential arrest perspectives involving persons experiencing mental health issues and may have arrest warrants for their arrest. This training will clarify some of the comprehensive challenges that police supervisors encounter on a daily basis. This additional training was mandatory and available for all members of the police department. The additional in service training focused on current legal updates and changes in MA General Laws. All training was directed towards better understanding of the Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) Commission that was established as part of the criminal justice reform legislation enacted in Chapter 253 of the Acts of 2020.
- The department has continued to have officers trained in the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) program. Currently, **85%** of the department has received this training. The CIT program is a community partnership between law enforcement, mental health professionals, addiction specialists and those impacted by Behavioral Health concerns such as mental health, developmental disabilities and addiction. The CIT program utilizes a group approach to identify appropriate resources for those impacted by mental illness away from the criminal justice system and into the health care system, when appropriate. The CIT program is supported by the statistics that show communities with CIT programs in place reflect a decrease in serious and fatal incidents. Officers benefit from the program in that the statistics show Law Enforcement Officers sustained injuries from "Mental Health/Disturbances" related calls drop as much as 80%. Lastly, the statistics show a 58% decrease in the number of arrests of people with mental illness. CIT programs have shown to help ensure Officer and Community safety in addition to the safety of the individual in crisis. The Department is the recipient of the *Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Excellence Award*, which highlights the Behavioral Health Unit (BHU) for demonstrating the value of collaboration and partnerships across disciplines, and the Department's commitment to serving community members impacted by behavioral health. The establishment of the BHU exemplifies this goal.
- The department had additional training in ICS-400: Advanced ICS Command and General Staff-Complex Incidents. This training is designed for emergency response personnel who would function as part of an Area Command, Emergency Operations Center, or Multiagency Coordination System during a large, complex incident or event, or those personnel who are or would likely be

- part of a local or regional Incident Management Team during a major incident. This training was offered and given as a direct result of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
- The department continues to conduct Advance Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) this curriculum and training is imperative for officers to receive for the current protocols and the appropriate active shooter response and the best practices for law enforcement responding to these types of critical incidents. This training was as a direct result of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. In addition to the department wide ALERRT training for the police department, there was similar training offered to the Revere School Department and collaboratively RPD worked with and trained teachers, school staff about active shooting and how to respond to an active shooter situation in the school environment. The department also issued every sworn police officer a key fob to gain immediate access to any school in the city in the event of an emergency or an active shooter situation.
- The department has acquired and equipped many of the front-line police vehicles with ballistic shields to better protect officers and members of the community. The ballistic shields will be easily accessible and can be quickly deployed in the case of a critical incident or an active shooter situation. The department purchased and upgraded all of the active shooter response bags in the police vehicles, and purchased easily identifiable medical bags for the police vehicles as well as throw ropes and life jackets for police vehicles in the event of a water rescue.
- The department purchased and replaced body armor for 20 officers in collaboration with the Bureau of Justice Assistance with the BJA Bulletproof Vest Partnership program. The department will pay 50% of the cost and the BJA will match the remaining 50%. The department purchased additional rifle rated protection to upgrade current vests.

- The department purchased sound dampening for the patrol rifles for Officer safety and scene control. Sound dampening will prevent permanent officer hearing loss if there is a discharge in an indoor setting and will prevent public panic if discharged during a critical incident.
- For officer wellness at the range environment, the department purchased better and upgraded hearing protection for officers on the range. The department conducted additional training on Lead exposure and put new measures in place for range training. The department purchased lead wipes for officers to clean their hands and equipment from lead particles after range activities.
- The department received delivery of upgraded police sidearm equipment consistent with police reform. Officers received 2 days of training with the upgraded sidearm The upgraded sidearm is equipped with a mounted light which will assist officers with properly identifying objects in an assailant's hand. The sidearm has a mounted holographic sight which increases an officers' accuracy to ensure innocent bystanders are not harmed while deploying necessary lethal force. Initially, this was going to be a 4-year program due to the needs of the department and the overwhelming success of the initial trial period, the transition was shortened to a 1-year program, with the department fully transitioned by mid-May of 2024.
- The department purchased several new steel targets for firearms training these steel targets are much more durable, and a good additional training aid for officers to better build their confidence and firearms skills.
- The department purchased three new fully marked police vehicles and took delivery of two fully marked, Ford Expedition, Supervisor Command vehicles. The Supervisor "Command" vehicles are larger utility vehicles that are needed to carry extra equipment, including several less-lethal options required by the new Police Reform Legislation. The command vehicles will carry and contain most of the equipment officers may need at the scene of a critical incident. The three new marked police vehicles are already being utilized in the patrol division. All the purchased vehicles are replacing older, outdated police vehicles that are being cycled out of the fleet. The newly purchased vehicles will all have the newest updated police equipment available.
- The department purchased an additional 5 Motorola, digital handheld portable two-way radios to replace older, antiquated outdated version radios. These replacement digital radios will be compatible with the new digital radio system.
- The department continues to utilize the recently purchase training/shooting trailer for annual and additional training. By training in this firearms trailer officers have the option to live fire and/or virtual reality (VR) training scenario type drills. This is essential to officers receiving quality, reality-based training necessary for police officers in the newly created police reform laws and legislation. The project was funded by the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) and is used collaboratively by three other local

police departments. It has been very successful for training and was used extensively for the police department's recent transition to the newly acquired side arms.

- The department sponsored a weeklong summer day program through the Police Activities League (PAL), offering educational and recreational opportunities for children entering 7<sup>th</sup> grade through High School.
- The department expanded the Police Athletic League (PAL) programming to include the recently created boxing program into a daily summer program during summer vacation. The Revere Boxing Program has been very successful and continues to be open every afternoon to high school and middle school students. The program is open to both boys and girls. On half school days, the School Resource Officers (SRO's) have "Half Day Hoops" and "Half Day Soccer" in the Revere High School gymnasium. Food and drinks are purchased by the department and provided to the students in the program. The Revere Police Department has been working in a collaborative effort with Revere Parks and Recreation for additional resources and support.

- The department was able to obtain an additional supply of Naloxone a lifesaving medication that can reverse an overdose from opioids including heroin, fentanyl and prescription opioid medications. Each officer in the department was given 2 4mg Naloxone nasal spray to carry on their person. This is in addition to the Naloxone that is already in every police vehicle.
- The department continues to have success with receiving information from the Revere PD app and *tip411* anonymous text a tip system that is 100% anonymous. The technology removes all identifying information from the sender. Using this method, the public is able to share anonymous tips and information with the police and allows police officers to respond back creating a two-way conversation that is totally anonymous. Residents can connect to the Revere Police Department to learn information, view alerts and

![](_page_194_Picture_2.jpeg)

- submit anonymous tips from their smartphone. The department has received substantial information regarding crimes involving illegal narcotics and received a substantial tip regarding illegal firearms. As a result of that tip, a large amount of firearms was seized by the Criminal Investigation Division. The system also allows the Revere Police Department to send out important information to the community members that are utilizing the app system.
- Last year, the department, in collaboration with the Revere Public Schools, purchased and obtained a comfort dog that will be with a School Resource Officer on a daily basis. The department comfort dog, "Charlie" has been a tremendous acquisition for the police department and school department. "Charlie" utilized in the schools and for community engagement and has fostered positive interactions with the community.
- Last year, the department received funding from Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) for an additional K9 (Labrador) that is specially trained in locating firearms, ammunition and explosive detection. The K9 has recently completed annual training with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and is assigned to the patrol division. The K9 will be used for special events, such as the annual Sandcastles Event at Revere Beach and other large events and venues in the city.
- The department continues to be actively involved and utilize the regional Critical Incident Stress Management Team (CISM) to debrief and assist officers that have been involved/exposed to critical incidents. This regional peer support program is necessary and has been extremely beneficial for the health and wellness of the officers that serve the community.

![](_page_194_Picture_7.jpeg)

• The department continues to engage the community during such events as the annual National Night Out. Last year's event was extremely successful, and we will continue to work collaboratively with our community partners including the Parks and Recreation Department, Public Health Department, Chelsea District Court and the Revere Public School Department. The event takes place annually in August.

# 220 - Fire Department

Contact Information: Christopher Bright, Fire Chief, 781-286-8365 Location: Revere Fire Department, 400 Broadway, Revere, 02151

### Mission Statement

To provide the highest quality fire suppression, prevention, rescue, and emergency services to the citizens of Revere, and those visiting, and maintain the expertise and training to provide these services with the utmost dedication, pride, and efficiency.

### FY2024 Accomplishments

- Hired a new civilian certified apparatus mechanic. New apparatus' have become more complex, computer controlled, and it is no longer possible to service our apparatus using in-house fire department personnel. We are now able to comply with proper annual NFPA testing and inspection of our pumps, aerial ladders, and ground ladders. With a properly maintained fleet we expect to increase the service life of our apparatus. Having safe and properly operating apparatus and equipment is of the utmost importance as part of our mission.
- Secured a MEMA Emergency Management Preparedness Grant in the amount of \$27,950.00 for the purchase of a new 30 KW diesel emergency backup generator for Headquarters. The new generator is scheduled for installation in the spring 2024 and will replace the existing natural gas emergency backup generator that has been in service for over 30 years.
- Placed an order for (2) two new engines and (1) one new ladder truck to replace Engine 4, Ladder 1 and to put into service a new Engine 2 at the soon-to-be-reactivated firehouse in the Point of Pines district. Replacing and adding this apparatus to our fleet, along with the previous capital purchases of Engine 3 and Engine 5, will move us closer to our goal of replacing the entire fleet of apparatus' and maintaining several reserve apparatus' that can be put into service during large scale incidents, special events, and for use as replacements while repairs or maintenance are being performed on the front-line apparatus'.
- Installed a new heating and cooling system in our Engine 5 (Freeman Street) firehouse. The old heating system was broken and unrepairable, and had no option for central cooling. The new system provides both central heating and cooling and will increase efficiency while savingon operating costs.

## FY2025 Goals & Objectives

1. **Goal:** Hire 6 new firefighters in preparation for the reopening of E2's firehouse in the Point of Pines district.  
   **Objective:** These new members will allow us to operate this recommissioned fire company that has been out of service since 1990 and bring us into compliance with NFPA 1710 standards. This will enhance the safety of our citizens and members, while responding to and working at all types of emergency incidents.  
   **Mayoral Focus Area:** Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services, Achieving a Common Goal, Culture Based on Results, Benefitting Neighborhoods.
2. **Goal:** Applied for an AFG Grant to purchase a new SCBA compressor for Headquarters.  
   **Objective:** If awarded, this grant will fund the purchase of a new NFPA compliant breathing air compressor, allowing us to recharge and maintain our breathing apparatus' more efficiently and with a greater margin of safety.  
   **Mayoral Focus Area:** Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services, Achieving a Common Goal, Culture Based on Results, Benefitting Neighborhoods.
3. **Goal:** To purchase and install a new diesel fuel pump and repair the Veeder Root system for the pump at Central Firehouse, to replace the current pump.  
   **Objective:** The current pump is corroded and rotted through, which causes moisture to get inside the gear mechanism(s). This is a danger, as it causes intermittent pump failure during cold/inclement weather. The computerized monitoring system, that is used to monitor the tank for dangerous inground fuel leaks, has been inoperable for many years, and is required by the EPA to monitor the state of the inground fuel tank.  
   **Mayoral Focus Area:** Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services, Achieving a Common Goal, Benefitting Neighborhoods.

**4. Goal:** To complete crucial repairs to Central and Freeman Street Firehouses.

**Objective:** Replace and upgrade the obsolete and inefficient HVAC system(s) at the Central Firehouse. We have been spending an inordinate amount of funds to continue to operate old and outdated HVAC equipment. Equipment replacement parts are becoming scarce and very expensive and will at some point be unavailable. Replacement of the outdated equipment will provide reliable and energy-efficient heating and cooling.

**Mayoral Focus Area:** Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services, Achieving a Common Goal, Fiscal Responsibility.

**5. Goal:** Purchase One (1) new 2025 Ford F250 Utility Pickup for our mechanic to replace a 2016 Ford F250 pickup. The current mechanics truck is in disrepair, does not have apparatus fueling equipment onboard, and is not properly equipped to make road repairs or repairs at incident scenes.

**Objective:** Replace outdated vehicles that have reached the end of their useful life cycle and improve the safety and efficiency of our vehicle fleet.

**Mayoral Focus Area:** Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services, Achieving a Common Goal, Benefitting Neighborhoods.

**6. Goal:** Purchase Two (2) new 2025 Ford Interceptors to replace a 2008 Chevrolet Tahoe which is nearing the end of its service life, and a 2008 Ford Taurus which was previously removed from service and auctioned off. These new vehicles will be assigned to the Fire Prevention Division.

**Objective:** Replace outdated vehicles that have reached the end of their useful life cycle and improve the safety and efficiency of our vehicle fleet.

**Mayoral Focus Area:** Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services, Achieving a Common Goal, Benefitting Neighborhoods.

<sup>+</sup> Dependent on if Revere hosts another EA shelter site- determined by the state.

<sup>\*</sup>Dependent on severity and number of fires or other emergencies.

<sup>\*\*</sup> All City Buildings now have at least one updated and serviced AED. Some buildings have more than one. In future years we will focus on consistently servicing the AED equipment and potentially expanding to non-City Building if funding allows.

<sup>\*\*\*</sup>311's Budget Performance Measures report outcome measures of Rodent Control Program.

<sup>\*\*\*\*</sup> City of Revere was not part of the Community Narcan Program until FY24 and therefore we were unable to accurately track until FY24.

<sup>^</sup> Unable to accurately track this during FY22 due to not having Apricot software in place.

<sup>^^</sup> With the onset of Apricot Software programing, implemented in FY24, we can accurately track this statistic for the first time.

# 541 - Elder Affairs

Contact Information: Debra Peczka DiGiulio, Director, 781-286-8156

Location: Rossetti-Cowan Senior Center, 25 Winthrop Avenue, Revere, 02151

## Mission Statement

To empower our senior community by innovating and delivering quality programs, information, advice, and access to the resources that will meet the changing needs of all of Revere's elder population.

## FY2024 Accomplishments

- Implemented eight new programs at the Senior Center including Pickleball, Water Aerobics, Breakfast Book Club, Cribbage, Pokeno, Movie Mondays, Massage Therapy and Musical Bingo.
- Enjoyed monthly birthday parties and events such as cooking classes, sports watch parties, nutrition talks, invite speakers that interest and entertain seniors (forensic talk), ESL classes, computer classes and special summer trips to the beach.
- Manage events that connect seniors with assistance, such as CAPIC, ESAC, Mass Save, Revere Fire Department, Revere Police Department, local food resources, City Hall departments, etc.
- Conduct weekly blood pressure screenings in conjunction with the Department of Public Health. Work in partnership with Mystic Valley Elder Services to provide a weekly Mental Health Outreach Coordinator for our seniors to speak individually and confidentially about any problems they may be experiencing with health, housing, or family issues. The coordinator will then assist and connect seniors to the resources necessary to resolve the problem. We offer monthly podiatry appointments, hearing tests, massage therapy and monthly visits from our RPD therapy dog, Charlie.

## FY2025 Goals & Objectives

1. **Goal**: Introduce music and art programs at the Senior Center.
   - **Objective**: Offer music and art programs such as singing groups, theatre training and visual arts for seniors to improve the health, well-being, and independence of older adults in Revere. These programs will Improve cognitive function, memory, and self-esteem. Music has been proven to reduce stress, aggression, agitation, and apathy, as well as promoting social interaction.
   - **Mayoral Focus Area**: Achieving a Common goal, Culture Based on Results, Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services.
2. **Goal**: Deconstruct and build new senior center ADA accessible entrance ramp and stairs in front of building.

<u>Objective</u>: Work in partnership with the City of Revere's Chief of Infrastructure and Engineering, Don Ciaramella, the Engineering Department, and CSS Architects to prepare a formal agreement for a design and construction timeline proposal. This project will be fully funded, for both design services and construction costs, with ARPA funds to update a non-conforming ADA Accessible ramp. Once the design and timeline are complete, the project will go out to bid for construction to begin this summer.

<u>Mayoral Focus Area:</u> Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services, Achieving a Common Goal, Culture Based on Results, Benefitting Neighborhoods.

3. <u>Goal</u>: Secure a MassDOT Community Transit Grant in conjunction with the Community Development Department to purchase a new van for the senior center and hire a van driver to provide Revere seniors and veterans transportation to medical appointments outside of Revere.

<u>Objective</u>: Currently, Revere Elder Affairs vans only provide transportation within the City of Revere. This grant would allow Revere seniors and veterans transportation to hospitals and doctor's offices outside of the Revere area to appointments at MGH, Jamaica Plains VA Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, New England Baptist, etc. This van will free seniors and veterans the stress and financial obligation of tolls, parking fees, confusing traffic patterns and walking from parking lots. With this grant, a 2024 van would be purchased for approximately \$105,000 with \$14,978.00 funded through the Elder Affairs budget and the remainder funded with State funds. The State would also match \$31,060 in mobility management expenses.

Mayoral Focus Area: Achieving a Common Goal, Culture Based on Results, Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services.

#### FY2025 Goals & Objectives

1) <u>Goal</u>: Become a full-time regularly staffed department within the City of Revere.

<u>Objective</u>: Be able to continue providing the necessary time and resources for the disabled residents of Revere.

Mayoral Focus Area: Achieving a Common Goal, Culture Based on Results, Fiscal Responsibility.

2) <u>Goal</u>: Pursue Grant opportunity to establish an "All Abilities Day out at the Beach" For our residents with physical and intellectual disabilities.

<u>Objective</u>: This would allow us to have "All Abilities Day" at Revere Beach for the Disabled Community. We would then be able to have this annually.

<u>Mayoral Focus Area:</u> Provide Equitable Municipal Resources and Services, Achieving a Common Goal, Culture Based on Results, Benefitting Neighborhoods

3) <u>Goal</u>: Establish a permanent policy within the City of Revere that all publicly run city meetings and boards have live streamed Hybrid capabilities both online and through Revere TV.

<u>Objective</u>: This would allow people of all abilities, languages ages, and schedules to be able to take part and have a voice at all public meetings. Live translations would also then be capable due to technology. The Commission on Disabilities is looking to pilot an ASL interpreter program at our monthly Zoom meetings with the hope of expanding this to all city meetings.

Mayoral Focus Area: Achieving a Common Goal, Culture Based on Results, Fiscal Responsibility.

4) <u>Goal</u>: To create a live working ADA plan for the City Capital Improvement Plan as outlined in City of Revere Transition plan that was done by EMG Engineering

<u>Objective:</u> This would allow the city to make a schedule of ADA improvements to Municipal Buildings outlined in the fully detailed documents and assessments done by EMG. A plan should be created so that each year the city can update this document and make sure work is being done so that our buildings meet the requirements not only for our residents but also for our employees.

<u>Mayoral Focus Area:</u> Achieving a Common Goal, Culture Based on Results, Fiscal Responsibility.

### SUPERINTENDENT'S FOREWORD

For the fourth year in a row, the Revere Public Schools is in a position of relative financial stability. The combination of federal pandemic stimulus funds, the state's continued implementation of the Student Opportunity Act, and other grant funding will allow us to continue our efforts toward right-sizing our staff, purchasing new instructional tools, upgrading technology and facilities, and providing appropriate supplemental services for all students. We are thankful to all of our elected officials who have acted on their promises to do what is right for the children of our nation and provide appropriate educational services on the heels of the pandemic.

Our funding increase wasn't as substantial as last year, but is sufficient to maintain efforts initiated over recent years. Our priorities in this budget are informed by our 2020-2025 five-year plan which was informed by family, student, and staff input from our community meeting which took place just prior to COVID and was attended by over 100 stakeholders. Spending is centered on our District Strategic Objectives to 1) build an antiracist community, 2) promote social and emotional health, and 3) meet the needs of all students.

This budget aims to enable the actualization of our Improvement Goals, which are to:

- > Increase gender and racial diversity of staff, particularly among teachers and administrators
- > Provide training and learning experiences on antiracism, restorative practices and equity for all staff members and students
- > Infuse equitable practices across the district
- > Create opportunities for parent engagement and input in school/district decision-making
- > Increase opportunities for students to have voice and choice in their academic programs
- > Ensure teaching practices across classrooms focus on effective, student centered, deeper learning experiences

Although we don't have additions to this year's budget on the scale that we have recently, we've prioritized adequate staffing at the middle school level necessitated by the School Committee's reorientation toward tracking, as well as the continued re-organization of Special Education and increased staffing of English Learner programs. We have also budgeted toward strengthening our Early Childhood program with large grant investments for the McKinley building project and an Early Childhood Director. To relieve overcrowding at the High School, we've also begun the work of contracting for portable classrooms.

We are aggressively building savings to ensure funding cliffs, which are nearing since ESSER funds expire this year. In addition, SOA will be fully funded in FY27. It is then that we anticipate a reduction in year-over-year Chapter 70 increases and hope that our current fiscal conservatism will prevent extreme reductions to staffing for FY28.

Thanks are due to all school committee members and others who have assisted with the development of this budget, but in particular to our Chief Financial Officer, Matthew Kruse, and to Assistant Superintendent, Dr. Danielle Mokaba.

Sincerely, Dr. Dianne Kelly, Superintendent

## ESSENTIAL INFORMATION

#### Here are key points of information as we build this budget:

- Senate Budget increased Net School Spending Requirement by \$7,747,255.
- -~\$2.5M of instructional staff was brought into the budget from ESSER III.
- Mobilizing \$8M of CFWD.
- Cost of .75% June 30 raise given to all insurance-eligible staff was ~\$600K.

### SCHEDULE 19 ANALYSIS

Each year City and School Department officials negotiate an agreement of what monies the City will spend on behalf of the School Department and what monies the School Department will spend on behalf of the City. Below is a list of material changes in this year's Schedule 19 agreement. (Note: Our negotiations are still ongoing as of the publishing of this first version of the budget.)

#### Here are key changes from last year:

- Crossing Guards moved to purview of the Parking Department
- New insurance percentage splits enacted (77.5/22.5)
- ESSER III contributed \$700K to insurance costs in FY24 but won't in FY25.

### CFWD ANALYSIS

At the end of each fiscal year, the School Department carries forward a certain amount of unexpended funds that have been realized in Net School Spending-eligible accounts and must be re-appropriated and spent in the subsequent fiscal year to meet the DESE's Net School Spending requirement. During our budget process we estimate what that carry forward amount will be based on current year spending trends. We then earmark a certain amount of those carry forward funds to cover instructional costs for classroom teachers. Any additional carry forward funds are either held as District Reserve or re-appropriated for other purposes by the School Committee.

Each year our actual carry forward amount is composed of 3 different amounts:

- 1: Funds realized through the liquidation of previous year's encumbrances. (These encumbrances were reported as expenditures on the EOYR, but since we never actually paid the bills (i.e. never actually spent the money) we are required to spend these dollars in the subsequent fiscal year.)
- 2: Surplus funds realized from current year budget.
- 3: District Reserve.

# CFWD & DISTRICT RESERVE ALLOCATIONS

Based on the preceding analysis, our intention is to use the first \$8,000,000 of CFWD that we must spend in order to meet our Net School Spending requirement for FY24 on classroom teachers according to the following breakout. All additional CFWD that must be spent on Net School Spending eligible expenditures will be properly appropriated by the School Committee once the City formally closes the FY24 books.

## NET SCHOOL SPENDING ANALYSIS

Each year the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education requires the City of Revere to spend a minimum amount of money on education. This amount is referred as our "Net School Spending Requirement." The chart format on the subsequent page is taken from the DESE's End of Year Financial Report (EOYR) where it is determined whether or not the City met its obligation. There is a 5% allowance for underspending in any given fiscal year. If the City falls short of its obligation in a given fiscal year, the amount it was short by gets added to the expectation of what it will spend in the subsequent fiscal year. This additional amount does not appear on the "cherry sheet" that the Commonwealth of Massachusetss publishes. Nor does it appear in the DESE's Net School Spending Requirement formula worksheet. Rather, it appears on line 32 of the EOYR's Net School Spending Requirement Report. The specific line is entitled "Unexpended Net School Spending."

### NET SCHOOL SPENDING PROJECTION

| Preliminary Required Net School Spending    | 125,462,678 | 142,967,579 | 150,714,834 |
| Additional Carry Forward Required To Spend  | 3,099,045   | 4,986,185   | 6,767,617   |
| Required Net School Spending on EOYR        | 128,561,723 | 147,953,764 | 157,482,451 |
| Preliminary Actual Net School Spending      | 126,255,875 | 143,280,316 | 159,482,451 |
| Line 60 Pr Yr Liq of Reported Encumbrances* | (2,680,337) | (2,094,170) | (2,000,000) |
| Actual Net School Spending                  | 123,575,538 | 141,186,147 | 157,482,451 |

<sup>\*</sup> Since we report encumbrances as expenses on the EOYR but (naturally) do not actually pay all encumbrances out to the penny, the DESE requires us to actually spend thise liquidated funds in the subsequent year. This is why they reduce our preliminary Net School Spending amount by the amount of liqudated encumbrances from the previous year. This is also why School Committee always re-appropriates this portion of the CFWD each year - so we can actually spend it.

(\$150,563,632 + \$8,767,617 = \$159,482,451)

<sup>\*\*</sup> What this cell assumes is that we will spend a minimum of \$8,767,617 of CFWD funds on Net School Spending eligible expenses in FY25 to meet our Net School Spending Requirement based on what our original FY25 Net School Spending Requirement is.

### NORTHEAST METROPOLITAN REGIONAL VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

#### FY 2025 BUDGET

Approved Budget

April 11, 2024

340

# The following FY25 School Budget is submitted by the Northeast Metropolitan Administration for the School Committee's review and consideration.

This budget was developed in support of our mission statement of supplying our students a rigorous academic and career/technical education.

Historically, we have been able to limit assessments to a 3% increase due to additional Chapter 70 funding commensurate with an increase in student enrollment. Due to spikes in the DESE net school spending requirement and minimum required contribution determined by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, which are metrics derived from the income and property wealth of the citizens of each member community, and with lower than anticipated Chapter 70 funding, we are unable to keep assessments at or below the targeted level. Based on the DESE formula, the net school spending for Northeast Metro Tech, which is the minimum amount the district is required to spend on education, has increased to from \$29,763,087 to \$31,935,942, or an increase of 2,172,855. Of that \$2,172,855 increase, the Chapter 70 funding only covers \$1,192,657 of the total increase. The resulting difference is passed on to the member communities in their required contribution, which equates to an increase of \$980,198, a 6.25% increase over FY24.

In a district spending right at minimum contribution levels, this would result in a minimum assessment increase of 6.25%. As our district has normally assessed our members slightly above the minimum to meet our operating needs, we do not have to assess our member communities the full minimum contribution increase. The total operating assessment before capital for FY25 is \$17,178,832, \$966,260 or 5.96% over the FY24 operating assessment. FY25 marks the third year of a capital assessment which will be used to pay for the principal and interest on our bond issue for our approved school building project. The third year payment has increased to \$5,211,350, as we will be borrowing an additional \$60,000,000 for the school building project expenses. This been assessed to the member communities to pay for the principal and interest payment on the third year of bonding. This payment alone represents an 18.78% increase to the total assessment. When the operating assessment and capital assessment are combined, the total assessment for FY25 is \$22,390,182, an increase of \$4,440,010, or 24.74%. We were able to minimize the original operating assessment by utilizing the following funding and strategies:

- Increase in Chapter 70 funding of \$1,192,657 more than the budgeted FY24 amount
- We plan is to utilize \$400,000 from excess and deficiency certified funds to offset our budget assessment impact to member communities in FY25 of which, \$400,000 will be coupled with our \$1,300,000 transportation reimbursement received in FY24 to offset the cost of transportation to the member communities in FY25.

With the increase in projected revenue and use of E&D, we were able to reduce the financial impact to our member communities. Northeast Metropolitan Regional Vocation School's total operating budget request for FY25 is \$39,355,813. This represents an increase of \$5,432,667 over the FY24 budget appropriation. In addition to the \$3,473,750 increase in the capital assessment due to new borrowing, from \$1,737,600 in FY24 to \$5,211,350 in FY25, the major driving factors of the operating budget increase are as follows:

| Increase for Benefits                                                                  | \$ 7,707   |
| Increase for Special Ed Services                                                       | \$ 50,000  |

We were able to offset the total cost of the operating budget by reducing the following line items by evaluating historical cost data and future needs:

| Salary Savings                                                                | Amount      |

A detailed summary of revenues and expenditures can be found in the next section.

The FY25 budget proposal includes the following highlights and assumptions:

Based on our Chapter 70 formula calculation, Northeast Metro Tech is projected to receive \$15,265,631 in aid for FY25. This amount is \$1,192,657 higher than our budgeted aid in FY24.

We anticipate FY25 transportation revenue of \$1,300,000, which is \$100,000 more than the revenue we received in FY24.

#### Summary

Regionalization exists as a measure to offer services at a reduced cost to its member districts. Knowing the financial constraints faced by each member City and Town, Northeast aims to limit the annual operating assessment increase. We are able to attain that goal by using \$400,000 from our other funding sources to offset total expenditures, therefore reducing the assessment.

### **Section IV- Enterprise Funds**

#### **Enterprise Funds Overview**

#### Description of the Purpose of an Enterprise Fund

An enterprise fund establishes a separate accounting and financial reporting mechanism for municipal services for which a fee is charged in exchange for goods or services. Revenues and expenditures of an Enterprise Fund are segregated into a separate fund with its own financial reporting and accountability.

An Enterprise Fund raises revenues through its own user charges and, where applicable, other funding sources. A community may choose to recover total service costs through user charges, but it is not required. The city of Revere has two enterprise funds, Water/Sewer and a Solid Waste enterprise fund. The Water/ Sewer enterprise fund is a full cost recovery enterprise fund. What this means is that all operating costs, both direct and indirect, are covered through revenues generated from operations. However, the Solid Waste enterprise fund does not generate enough revenue to be full cost recovery. In this case, it is important to represent the solid waste enterprise fund as such because it functions as its own business operation. As such, for FY2025, it is estimated that the General Fund will contribute \$4,487,700 towards the total operating cost of \$4,827,700.

#### Water/Sewer Enterprise Fund

The Water/Sewer Enterprise Fund was formed in FY2002. Revenues consist of water/sewer user charges, penalties & interest assessments, water/sewer liens added to taxes, and miscellaneous revenue. Costs include mandated MWRA assessments, debt service, salaries, expenses, shared overhead costs and fringe benefits. As mentioned above, the Water/Sewer Enterprise Fund is a "full cost recovery" enterprise fund, meaning that all revenues generated from user charges cover both direct costs of the enterprise fund, as well as indirect costs (shared overhead) needed to operate and administer the fund.

The proposed FY2025 total cost of \$34,391,502 includes shared overhead costs, pension, and health benefits of \$2,648,971. The total direct expenses of \$31,742,531 represent an increase of \$1,190,860 over FY2024. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in debt service payments of \$472,326 and increases in both MWRA water (\$220,039) and sewer (\$322,119) assessments. To smooth these increases in fixed costs, all other expenses that were not fixed have been increased by just \$78,777, and payroll expenses increased by a modest \$13,604.

Since FY2023, the city had adopted a three-year fixed rate structure where rates were increasing by 4.25% annually. These rates were stabilized, in part, by using \$3 million in ARPA funds over the past three years. FY2025 is the last year utilizing ARPA funds of \$500,000 to offset rate increases. Based upon actual revenues collected in FY2023 and FY2024 YTD, it is estimated that to keep the rate structure as adopted in FY2023, the City may need to supplement the revenue of the Water/Sewer fund with \$2 million from the Water/Sewer Stabilization Fund. We will look to appropriate the funds in the fall, prior to setting the FY2025 tax rate, using actual data collected through October 31, 2024. For the first part of FY2025, the city will be doing a comprehensive rate study which will contemplate tiered rate structures, monthly billing, and other considerations to ensure that water/sewer rates for FY2026 and beyond will not need to use one-time revenues to continue operations.

For FY2025, the City has updated its Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for water/sewer/drains, which can be found in the CIP portion of the budget. The addition of a multi-year Capital Improvement Plan and FY2025 Capital budget will allow for the continuation of improvements to our water, sewer, and drainage systems citywide, as well as the purchase of equipment needed to properly maintain and repair the infrastructure of the City.

#### Solid Waste Enterprise Fund

The Solid Waste Enterprise Fund was adopted in FY2019 as part of the budget process. Revenues collected include charges for bulky item pickup, trash violations, fees, and other miscellaneous revenue. Costs include salaries, and contracted services for collection and disposal. As stated above, the Solid Waste Enterprise fund is heavily subsidized by General Fund revenues.

The proposed FY2025 total costs of \$4,827,700 is an estimate based on actual historical data. The FY2025 total costs represent an increase of \$328,120 over FY2024. Increases in the cost of disposing of single stream recycling continue to be the biggest challenge for the City. The City has negotiated a new five-year contract for solid waste and yard waste disposal that will help stabilize our disposal costs, with annual increases of 4.25%, with five one-year options that allow either side to terminate the agreement.

During FY2025, the City is working on a fee survey with comparable cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth to help reduce reliance on the General Fund subsidy. Fees to be researched include pay as you throw as well as bulky item disposal rates. Also for FY2025, the city has negotiated an annual contribution of \$25,000 from WIN Waste to be put towards the establishment of a composting program, in hopes of reducing rubbish disposal tonnage. It is also a goal of the Mayor to ramp up recycling efforts to divert recyclable items from the solid waste stream.

Free cash is the remaining, unrestricted funds from operations of the previous fiscal year including unexpended free cash from the prior year, excess of actual receipts and budgeted line item funds unused. The amount certified is reduced by unpaid taxes and certain deficits as of June 30th.

The chart above and narrative below present information about Free Cash, the undesignated Fund Balance available to be appropriated. In 2003, the City of Revere adopted a policy whereby a minimum of 15% of annual certified free cash is appropriated into the Stabilization Fund. Beginning in FY2018, the City has been growing the Capital Improvement Stabilization Fund by appropriating 20% of Free Cash.

All municipal governments should maintain reserves which can be used for special purposes or in case of emergencies. Credit rating agencies look at the reserves as a measure to determine whether a city or town is being managed well. These reserves are officially the Undesignated General Fund Balance, commonly referred to as Free Cash. They represent the amount of fund balance which the City has not currently designated for any specific purpose.

Each year, the State examines the City's books and certifies the amount that the City has in available reserves or Free Cash. City ordinances state that within ninety days of the certification of Free Cash by the Department of Revenue, the mayor and city council shall approve a transfer to the Stabilization Fund of at least 15% of the total certified free cash.

At June 30, 2023, the most recent year that has been certified by the state, Free Cash totaled \$3,665,974.

<sup>\*</sup> FY2015 and FY2016 Free Cash were combined due to a timing issue in FY2016.

Motor Vehicle Excise: The Motor Vehicle Excise rate is \$25 per \$1000 valuation, per MGL Chapter 60A, Section 1. This revenue is collected by the City based on data provided by the Mass. Registry of Motor Vehicles. The Registry determines valuation based on manufacturer's list price and year of manufacture. The motor vehicle excise tax is collected by the City or Town in which a vehicle is principally garaged at the time of registration.

The City of Revere notifies the Registry of delinquent taxpayers, through an excise delinquent file prepared for the RMV by the deputy collector. Through a 'marking' process of the RMV, residents who do not pay their excise taxes in a timely manner are not allowed to renew registrations or licenses.

Payment in Lieu of Taxes: Many communities, including Revere, are incapable of putting all property within its borders to productive, tax generating uses. Federal, state and municipal facilities, hospitals, churches, and colleges are examples of uses that are typically exempt from local property tax payments. The City has this type of agreement with several entities, including the Revere Housing Authority.

<u>Licenses</u> and <u>Permits:</u> License and Permit revenues arise from the City's regulation of certain activities (e.g., selling alcoholic beverages). Engagement in these activities for a specific period requires a person or organization to pay a license fee. All fees are set either by: State law, City By-Law or Licensing Body.

<u>Fines</u> <u>and</u> <u>Forfeits:</u> <u>Court Fines</u> - Non parking offenses result in fines for moving violations. The police department has been focused on enforcing speed limits in local neighborhoods, due to the community's desire for public safety. Other moving violations that are included in this category are driving while intoxicated, passing in the wrong lane, and failing to stop at a traffic signal. These fines, collected by the District Court, are distributed to the City on a monthly basis

Parking Fines - The collection of outstanding parking fines continues to be an important source of revenue to the City. The timely collection of fines has been aided by automation, and violators are prohibited from renewing their driver's licenses and registrations until all outstanding tickets are paid in full under State law. Like Motor Vehicle Excise, those individuals who do not pay their parking tickets in a timely manner are not allowed to renew registrations and licenses through a 'marking process' at the RMV. The City of Revere notifies the Registry of delinquent fine payers, through its deputy collector, who prepares parking ticket delinquent files for the Registry of Motor Vehicles.

# Revenue Detail: Summary Charts

**State Local Aid Receipts ("Cherry Sheet")** - The Cherry Sheet is the official notification by the Commissioner of Revenue to municipalities and school districts of estimated state aid to be paid and charges to be assessed over the next fiscal year. Cherry Sheets are issued once the state budget is enacted by the Legislature and approved by the Governor. Funds received under programs designated as "Offset Items" may be spent without appropriation in the local budget. All other receipt items on the Cherry Sheet are considered revenues of the municipality or regional school district's general fund and may be spent for any purpose, subject to appropriation.

### Total Cherry Sheet Revenue (Net of Offsets)

| Year | Actual                |

### Cherry Sheet Offsets -

The state provides receipts that are paid directly to departments through state granting agencies and are not part of the City's General Fund Cherry Sheet Revenue.

Although the School Lunch program is funded in both the FY2016 final budget and the Governor's budget proposal, the state has removed the estimate from the cherry sheet as this program is an education offset that has no impact on the tax rate setting.

Chapter 70 - Education Reform was undertaken in an effort to ensure both adequate funding of the Commonwealth's public schools and to bring equity to local taxation effort based on a community's ability to pay. Before receiving any educational aid, all districts are required to submit End of Year Pupil and Financial Reports to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

# **Section VI - Debt**

### **Debt Position Analysis**

#### **Authorization Procedure and Limitations**

Serial bonds and notes are authorized by vote of two-thirds of all the members of the city council, except refunding bonds which may be authorized by a majority vote of the city council. Borrowings for certain purposes require State administrative approval.

When serial bonds or notes have been authorized, bond anticipation notes may be issued by the officers authorized to issue the serial bonds or notes. Temporary loans in anticipation of the revenues of the fiscal year in which debt is incurred, or in anticipation of state and federal grants for any purpose for which the city may incur debt for a term of five years or longer, generally may be incurred by the treasurer with the approval of the mayor.

#### **Debt Limits**

General Debt Limit. The normal debt limit is 5 percent of the valuation of taxable property as last equalized by the State Department of Revenue. Cities and towns may authorize debt up to this amount without state approval. Municipalities may authorize debt up to twice this amount (the double debt limit) with the approval of the state Municipal Finance Oversight Board composed of the State Treasurer, the State Auditor, the Attorney General and the Director of Accounts.

There are many categories of general obligation debt which are exempt from and do not count against the general debt limit. Among others, these exempt categories include: revenue anticipation notes and grant anticipation notes; emergency loans; loans exempted by special laws; certain school bonds; sewer bonds; water bonds; bonds for electric, gas, community antenna television and telecommunication systems; solid waste disposal facility bonds; and economic development bonds supported by tax increment financing. Certain categories of general obligation bonds exempt from the general debt limit are subject to special debt limits, including certain bonds for housing, urban renewal, and economic development. Revenue bonds are not subject to these debt limits. The general debt limit applies at the time debt is authorized. The special debt limits generally apply at the time the debt is incurred.

#### **Types of Obligations**

General Obligations. Massachusetts cities and towns are authorized to issue general obligation indebtedness of these types:

<u>Serial Bonds and Notes.</u> Serial bonds and notes are generally required to be payable in annual principal amounts beginning no later than the end of the next fiscal year commencing after the date of issue and ending within the terms permitted by law. The principal amount of serial bonds and notes must be amortized in accordance with a level debt service schedule, or a schedule that provides for a more rapid amortization of principal. The principal

amounts of certain economic development bonds supported by tax increment financing may be payable in equal, diminishing or increasing amounts beginning within five years after the date of issue. The maximum terms of serial bonds and notes are designated by law and vary from one year to 40 years, depending on the purpose of the issue and, in some cases, in accordance with useful life guidelines promulgated by the State Department of Revenue. Serial bonds and notes may be issued for the purposes specified by law. In addition, serial bonds and notes may be issued for any other public work improvement or asset not specifically specified by law that has a useful life of at least five years. Bonds or notes may be made callable and redeemed prior to their maturity, and a redemption premium may be paid. Refunding bonds or notes may be issued subject to the maximum applicable term measured from the date of the original bonds or notes and must produce present value savings over the debt service of the refunded bonds. Generally, the first required annual payment of principal of the refunding bonds or notes cannot be later than the first principal payment of any of the bonds or notes being refunded; however, principal payments made before the first principal payment of any of the bonds or notes being refunded may be in any amount.

Serial bonds may be issued as "qualified bonds" with the approval of the state Municipal Finance Oversight Board composed of the State Treasurer, the State Auditor, the Attorney General and the Director of Accounts, subject to such conditions and limitations (including restrictions on future indebtedness) as may be required by the Board. Qualified bonds may mature not less than 10 nor more than 30 years from their dates and are not subject to the amortization requirements described above. The State Treasurer is required to pay the debt service on qualified bonds and thereafter to withhold the amount of the debt service paid by the State from state aid or other state payments; administrative costs and any loss of interest income to the State are to be assessed upon the city or town.

Tax Credit Bonds or Notes. Subject to certain provisions and conditions, the city council, with the approval of the Mayor, may designate any duly authorized issue of bonds or notes as "tax credit bonds" to the extent such bonds or notes are otherwise permitted to be issued with federal tax credits or other similar subsidies for all or a portion of the borrowing costs. Tax credit bonds may be made payable without regard to the annual installments required by any other law, and a sinking fund may be established for the payment of such bonds. Any investment that is part of such a sinking fund may mature not later than the date fixed for payment or redemption of the applicable bonds.

<u>Bond Anticipation Notes.</u> Bond anticipation notes generally must mature within two years of their original dates of issuance but may be refunded from time to time for a period not to exceed ten years from their original dates of issuance, provided that for each year that the notes are refunded beyond the second year they must be paid in part from revenue funds in an amount at least equal to the minimum annual payment that would have been required if the bonds had been issued at the end of the second year. The maximum term of bonds issued to refund bond anticipation notes is measured from the date of the original issue of the notes.

Revenue Anticipation Notes. The amount borrowed in each fiscal year by the issue of revenue anticipation notes is limited to the tax levy of the prior fiscal year, together with the net receipts in the prior fiscal year from the motor vehicle excise and certain payments made by the Commonwealth in lieu of taxes. The fiscal year ends on June 30. Notes may mature in the following fiscal year, and notes may be refunded into the following fiscal year to the extent of the uncollected, unabated current tax levy and certain other items, including revenue deficits, overlay

deficits, final judgments and lawfully unappropriated expenditures, which are to be added to the next tax levy, but excluding deficits arising from a failure to collect taxes of earlier years. (See "Taxation to Meet Deficits" under "PROPERTY TAXATION" above.) In any event, the period from an original borrowing to its final maturity cannot exceed one year.

<u>Grant Anticipation Notes</u>. Grant anticipation notes are issued for temporary financing in anticipation of federal or state grants. Generally, they must mature within two years but may be refunded from time to time as long as the municipality remains entitled to the grant or reimbursement.

Revenue Bonds. Cities and towns may issue revenue bonds for limited purposes, including for solid waste disposal facilities, water and sewer projects financed through the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust, and certain economic development projects supported by tax increment financing. Cities and towns having electric departments may also issue revenue bonds for electric power facilities, subject to the approval of the State Department of Public Utilities.

#### **Coverage of State Qualified Debt Service**

It is projected that state aid distributions from The Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the City will provide ample coverage of the City's outstanding state qualified debt service. The following table presents debt service on the City's state qualified bonds and the coverage ratio of total estimated state aid to projected qualified debt service. See "THE BONDS – State Qualified Bonds" and "INDEBTEDNESS – Types of Obligations – Serial Bonds and Notes" for a description of state qualified bonds.

<sup>(1)</sup> As of June 30, 2024, including subsequent issues.

<sup>(2)</sup> Includes total state aid available for coverage based on the estimated FY 2025 Cherry Sheets. State aid estimates above assume an increase at a rate of 2% each year after FY 2025. The State aid figures above no longer reflect school building assistance grants as such grants are no longer paid by the Commonwealth and are now paid by the Massachusetts School Building Authority. Therefore, such payments no longer constitute "distributable aid" of the Commonwealth under the Qualified Bond Act.

# Authorized Unissued Debt and Prospective Financing

Currently, the City has approximately \$546.4 million bonds authorized and unissued primarily for school projects (approximately \$498.8 million), water and sewer projects (approximately \$37.5 million) and the balance for various capital projects. It is anticipated that the water and sewer debt will be supported fully with user fees.

State legislation provides that all interest earned, and premiums received on certain of its school construction bonds and bond anticipation notes be placed in a separate account and used only to pay down certain school building debt. The balance of this account at June 30, 2022 was \$10,924.

The City authorized high school construction bonds in the amount of \$493,217,901 in May 2024. The City expects approximately 80% reimbursement on eligible projects costs from the MSBA.

## Overlapping Debt (1)

The City is located in Suffolk County and is a member of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (the "MBTA") was created in 1964 to finance and operate mass transportation facilities within the greater Boston metropolitan area. Under its enabling act, the MBTA is authorized to issue bonds for capital purposes, other than refunding bonds, and for certain specified purposes to an outstanding amount, which does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of \$3,556,300,000. In addition, pursuant to certain of the Commonwealth's transportation bond bills, the MBTA is authorized to issue additional bonds for particular capital projects. The MBTA also is authorized to issue bonds of the purpose of refunding bonds. Under the MBTA's enabling act debt service, as well as other operating expenses of the MBTA, are to be financed by a dedicated revenue stream consisting of the amounts assessed on the cities and towns of the MBTA and a dedicated portion of the statewide sales tax. The amount assessed to each city and town is based on its weighted percentage of the total population of the authority as provided in the enabling act. The aggregate amount of such assessments is not permitted to increase by more than 2.5 percent per year.

#### **Contractual Obligations**

Municipal contracts are generally limited to currently available appropriations. A city or town generally has authority to enter into contracts for the exercise of any of its corporate powers for any period of time deemed to serve its best interest, but generally only when funds are available for the first fiscal year; obligations for succeeding fiscal years generally are expressly subject to availability and appropriation of funds. Municipalities have specific authority in relatively few cases for long-term contractual obligations that are not subject to annual appropriation, including contracts for refuse disposal and sewage treatment and disposal. Municipalities may also enter into long-term contracts in aid of housing and urban renewal projects. There may be implied authority to make other long-term contracts required to carry out certain recurring basic municipal functions, such as contracts to purchase water from private water companies.

Municipal contracts relating to solid waste disposal facilities may contain provisions requiring the delivery of minimum amounts of waste and payments based thereon and requiring payments in certain circumstances without regard to the operational status of the facilities.

Municipal electric departments have statutory power to enter into long-term contracts for joint ownership and operation of generating and transmission facilities and for the purchase or sale of capacity, including contracts requiring payments without regard to the operational status of the facilities.

Pursuant to the Home Rule Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution, cities and towns may also be empowered to make other contracts and leases.

The City currently has an agreement with Capital Waste for collection of trash and recycling, and disposal of recycling, which expires June 30, 2025.

The City appropriated \$2,322,991 for hauling trash and recycling, \$1,639,997 for trash disposal, and \$360,000 for recycling disposal for fiscal 2025.

### Bond Rating: Revere, Massachusetts; Non-School State Programs

#### **Rating Action**

S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'AA+' long-term rating and 'AA' underlying rating (SPUR) to Revere, Mass.' anticipated \$14.7 million general obligation (GO) state qualified municipal-purpose loan of 2024 bonds. The outlook is stable.

The 'AA+' long-term rating reflects the security provided by the Massachusetts Qualified Bond Program, which we rate on par with the Massachusetts 'AA+' issuer credit rating and reflects the commonwealth's commitment to pay debt service on behalf of eligible participants from legally available funds. Under the Qualified Bond Act (Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44A), approval by the Municipal Finance Oversight Board, which oversees and monitors the program, is required. There is no appropriation risk related to the debt service payment.

Revere's full-faith-and-credit pledge, subject to Proposition 2 1/2 limitations, secures the limited-tax GO bonds. Despite commonwealth levy-limit laws, we did not make a rating distinction between the city's limited-tax GO pledge and general creditworthiness because our analysis of Revere's financial and economic conditions already includes tax limitations imposed on the city's revenue-raising ability.

#### Credit overview

Revere is a primarily residential community adjacent to Boston, to which it is connected by three subway stations and a local highway. It has significant Atlantic Ocean frontage, which, along with developable land, is leading to rapid property tax base growth. Assessed value (AV) continues to experience double-digit growth, averaging about 12.5% during the past three years, due to significant economic development and property appreciation. These development projects are all at various stages of completion and include different types, such as:

- A major multifamily and mixed-used project at the former Suffolk Downs racetrack, which should add about \$4 billion to the city's assessed value (AV) once complete and generate more than \$43 million in real estate tax revenue, coupled with substantial increases in local receipts and new job opportunities; and
- The redevelopment of a former petroleum-storage site into a logistics warehouse that should add more than \$200 million of AV.

Finances have remained stable during the past few fiscal years. Revere ended fiscal 2022 with positive operations due primarily to higher-than-budgeted local receipts while maintaining expenses at or below budget. For fiscal 2023, while revenue exceeded the budget and most expenditure items ended below budgetary estimates, we understand the city experienced higher-than-budgeted salary costs due to retroactive payments it had to make after settling some of its labor-union contracts, which ultimately led to a slight decrease in available reserves.

According to management, fiscal 2024 budget-to-actual results are on track with local receipts--such as building permits, investment, and other revenue--currently trending above budget. Therefore, the city currently expects to end fiscal 2024 with balanced operations and no expected reserve reduction. The proposed fiscal 2025 budget totals \$270.4 million and is balanced without any use of reserves or one-time revenue.

Following this issuance, Revere will have about \$252 million of total direct debt outstanding. We understand that in addition to smaller capital items, the city currently plans to issue about \$254 million for a new high school during the next three years. Total project costs are about \$493 million with the commonwealth funding the remainder. Therefore, even with commonwealth aid support, we expect fixed costs will likely increase during the next two years to four years as the city takes on the project, weakening our view of its debt profile.

Revere participates in Revere Contributory Retirement System, which is 66.6% funded as of fiscal 2023, with a net pension liability of \$111 million.

The city also maintains an other postemployment benefits (OPEB) trust that was 0.53% funded with a \$313 million net OPEB liability as of fiscal 2023. We understand that the city contributes about \$250,000 annually toward the OPEB trust and that it currently plans to increase the contribution once it fully funds the pension liability in 2034.

Additional rating factors include our opinion of Revere's:

- Stable tax base that continues to experience significant growth and property appreciation due to a strong real estate market and private-investment opportunities in a desirable location within the Boston metropolitan statistical area;
- Continued maintenance of very strong reserves through balanced results with further stable financial operations expected in fiscal 2024;
- Adequate management with standard financial-management policies, practices under our Financial Management Assessment (FMA) methodology-including its regular budget-to-actual reports to the governing body and multiyear financial and capital planning; it does not have a reserve policy with targeted minimums--and strong Institutional Framework score; and
- Moderate debt with low fixed costs--However, large retirement liabilities, with expected cost increases, and significant debt plans should weaken current debt ratios.

#### Environmental, social, and governance factors

We have evaluated environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors relative to Revere's economy, financial measures, management, and debt-and-long-term-liability profile. We view environmental factors as heightened due to significant tax base exposure along the Atlantic Ocean; management is working to mitigate this through adopting updated flood-plain maps and working with developers to ensure new development mitigates coastal risk. Revere is also leveraging commonwealth grants to undertake climate-resiliency projects. We view governance-and-social factors as neutral.

#### Stable Outlook

#### Downside scenario

We could lower the rating if Revere were to draw on reserves materially or if the debt-and-contingent-liability profile were to weaken significantly due to additional debt issuance or increasing retirement costs, pressuring finances.

#### Upside scenario

We could raise the rating if management were to maintain very strong budgetary flexibility through consistent positive financial performance while reducing long-term retirement liabilities and debt, coupled with improved economic indicators in-line with higher-rated peers and the continued formalization and integration of financial-management policies.

#### Basis of Accounting & Basis of Budgeting

#### **Basis of Accounting**

The modified accrual basis of accounting is used by all governmental fund types; general, enterprise, special revenue, trust, and agency funds.

Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recognized when susceptible to accrual, that is, when they become both measurable and available. "Measurable" means the amount of the transaction can be determined, and "available" means collectible within the current period, or soon enough thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of the current period. Property taxes are considered available if they are collected within 60 days after year-end. Expenditures are recorded when the related fund liability is incurred. Principal and interest on general long-term debt are recorded as fund liabilities when due. The accrual basis of accounting is utilized by non-expendable trust funds. Under this basis of accounting, revenues are recorded when earned, and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred.

#### **Basis of Budgeting**

An annual budget comprising the General Fund and both Enterprise funds is voted and approved by the City Council. Additional appropriations can be voted prior to the setting of the tax rate. Approval is also required for certain special revenue funds and for capital projects funded from borrowing authorizations. The Town's General Fund annual budget is adopted on a statutory basis that differs in some respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The major differences between the budgetary basis and GAAP accounting basis are that Budgeted revenues are recorded when cash is received (budgetary basis), as opposed to when susceptible to accrual (GAAP). The property tax levy is recorded as a receivable when levied but then is fully reserved until collected. Encumbrances are treated as expenditures in the year of the commitment.

#### **REVOLVING FUNDS**

A revolving fund is a place to set aside revenue received, through fees and charges, for providing a specific service or program. The revenue pool is, in turn, a source of funds available to use by a department without further appropriation to support the service or program. These funds are accounted for separately from the general fund. Many of these funds are established through Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) and are accounted for in the manner prescribed by the law. Some examples of revolving funds established by law are School Rental Receipts (M.G.L. Ch. 40 Sec. 3), Student Activity and Athletic Fund (M.G.L. Ch. 71 Sec 47), and Wetland Protection Fund (MGL Ch. 131 Sec. 40).

When a specific law does not exist for the establishment of a specific source and use of funds, cities and towns have the option to create general departmental revolving funds under M.G.L. Ch. 44 Sec. 53E½ (see below). These funds are created with city council approval. Departmental revolving funds identify which department's receipts are to be credited to the revolving fund and specifies the program or purposes for which money may be spent. It designates the department, board or official with authority to expend the funds and places a limit on the total amount of the annual expenditure. The Municipal Modernization Act has changed some of the language, and the changes to the language are described below.

#### MGL - Section 53 E ½

Notwithstanding section 53, a city or town may authorize by by-law or ordinance the use of one or more revolving funds by one or more municipal agencies, boards, departments, or offices, which shall be accounted for separately from all other monies in the city or town and to which shall be credited any fees, charges or other receipts from the departmental programs or activities supported by the revolving fund. Expenditures may be made from such revolving fund without further appropriation, subject to the provisions of this section; provided, however, that expenditures shall not be made or liabilities incurred from any such revolving fund in excess of the balance of the fund or in excess of the total authorized expenditures from such fund, and no expenditures shall be made unless approved in accordance with sections 41, 42, 52 and 56 of chapter 41.

Interest earned on any revolving fund balance shall be treated as general fund revenue of the city or town. No revolving fund may be established under this section for receipts of a municipal water or sewer department, a municipal hospital, a cable television access service, or facility or for receipts reserved by law or as authorized by law for expenditure for a particular purpose. Revolving fund expenditures shall not be made to pay wages or salaries for full-time employees unless the revolving fund is also charged for the costs of fringe benefits associated with the wages or salaries so paid; provided, however, that such prohibition shall not apply to wages or salaries paid to full-time or part-time employees who are employed as drivers providing transportation for public school students; provided further, that only that portion of a revolving fund which is attributable to transportation fees may be used to pay the wages or salaries of those employees who are employed as drivers providing transportation for public school students; and provided further, that any such wages or salaries so paid shall be reported in the budget submitted for the next fiscal year.

A revolving fund shall be established pursuant to this section by by-law or ordinance. The by-law or ordinance shall specify for each fund:

- (1) The programs or activities for which the revolving fund may be expended;
- (2) The departmental receipts in connection with those programs or activities that shall be credited to the revolving fund;
- (3) The board, department or officer authorized to expend from such fund; and
- (4) Any reporting or other requirements the city or town may impose. The establishment of any fund shall be made not later than the beginning of the fiscal year in which the fund shall begin.

Notwithstanding this section, whenever, during the course of any fiscal year, any new revenue source becomes available for the establishment of a revolving fund under this section, such a fund may be established in accordance with this section upon certification by the city auditor, town accountant, or other officer having similar duties that the revenue source was not used in computing the most recent tax levy.

The city or town shall, on or before July 1 of each year, vote on the limit on the total amount that may be expended from each revolving fund established under this section. In any fiscal year, the limit on the amount that may be spent from a revolving fund may be increased with the approval of the city council and mayor in a city or with the approval of the board of selectmen and finance committee in a town.

Upon termination of a revolving fund, the balance in the fund at the end of that fiscal year shall revert to surplus revenue at the close of the fiscal year.

The director of accounts may issue guidelines further regulating revolving funds established pursuant to this section.

# **Section VIII - Capital Improvement Plan**

### Capital Improvement Plan

#### Introduction

Over the next five years, the City of Revere plans to invest over \$83 million in general fund capital improvements citywide, not including the amounts assumed for the new Revere High School construction (estimated to cost a total of \$493 million). This figure includes an array of funding from local, grant, and enterprise sources. The City's Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for FY2024 to FY2029 strives to balance many significant and competing infrastructure needs, including vehicle and equipment acquisitions, parks and open space, public buildings and facilities, and roadways and sidewalks. Additionally, the City plans to invest over \$68 million for water, sewer, and drains projects over the next five years, with a FY2025 capital budget of just over \$7.5 million proposed.

The goal of the plan is to thoughtfully allocate the limited resources that are available, while considering the many needs identified by City departments and the School District. By looking out across multiple years, City officials can carefully schedule projects in a way to minimize the fiscal impact on local taxpayers, and department directors can plan for upgrades of equipment and infrastructure to reduce emergency repairs and purchases which can drive up costs. Departments can also contemplate and plan for multi-year projects such as the design and construction of a major roadway project or a new building, while being kept on task by being included in the CIP.

During the FY2025 fiscal year, another plan – building upon this one – will be developed for the subsequent five years. If more funding becomes available than currently anticipated, projects could be moved forward in time and/or additional projects could be added. Should finances be more constrained, projects could be moved back in time or taken off the list. Further, other projects not yet conceived of can be added if they advance the City's goals better than those included in the current version of the plan.

What is a capital budget? What is a capital project?

A capital budget is distinct from an operating budget in that the items included in a capital budget are typically large or infrequent expenses, such as construction of a new building or acquisition of a new dump truck, whereas an operating budget includes expenses that occur each year or are modest, such as salaries and vehicle maintenance. A capital budget identifies the array of resources to be used to fund a series of capital projects.

The Massachusetts Association of Town Finance Committees defines capital projects as "major, non-recurring expenditures, for one of the following purposes:

- acquisition of land for a public purpose;
- construction of a new facility or external expansion or major rehabilitation of an existing one. Examples of such town facilities include public buildings, water and sewer lines, roads and playing fields;
- purchase of vehicles or major equipment items;
- any planning, feasibility, engineering or design study related to a capital project or to a capital improvement program consisting of individual

projects;

- equipment for public improvements when they are first constructed such as furniture, office equipment, or playground equipment;
- major equipment which is expensive and has a relatively long life such as a fire apparatus, garbage trucks, and construction equipment."

The group goes on to indicate that, "typically capital projects do not include:

- equipment such as furniture or police or public works vehicles which are replaced annually in approximately the same quantity;
- equipment with a useful life of five years or less."

#### What is a capital plan?

According to the Massachusetts Department of Revenue (DOR), a capital plan is a blueprint for planning a community's capital expenditure and "one of most important responsibilities of local government officials." Putting together multiple years of capital spending into a plan, instead of looking at each year in isolation, has multiple benefits including:

- impacts on the operating budget can be minimized through thoughtful debt management;
- high-cost repairs and emergency acquisitions can be reduced by implementing regular vehicle and equipment replacement schedules, and by undertaking major facilities improvements, such as replacing roofs, before a problem becomes chronic and damage occurs;
- large scale, ambitious public improvements can be phased over multiple years;
- critical parcels of land can be purchased before costs increase;
- costly mistakes created by lack of coordination such as paving a street one year and then cutting into it the next year to install a sewer line can be avoided; and,
- methodical progress can be made toward meeting community goals.

#### CIP Overview

Over the course of the FY2024-FY2029 Capital Improvement Plan, the City of Revere will expend close to \$545 million in funds for all general fund capital expenditures, including the construction of a new high school, the revitalization of McMackin Park, the renovation of the former McKinley school, and citywide roadway, sidewalks, and other public infrastructure. These projects range in size from \$25k for planning various citywide projects, to \$3.75 million for the renovation of McMackin field. The 2025 general fund capital budget shows approximately \$22.4 million in expenditures, including \$430,000 for vehicles and equipment, \$1.35 million investment in parks and open space, \$11.3 million in public buildings and facilities, and \$9.3 million for roadways and sidewalks. The city plans to issue no bonded debt for FY2025, instead relying on grants and other financing sources as we prepare for the large debt obligation that will come as a result of building a new Revere High School at the site of the former Wonderland Dog Park.

Funding for FY2025 expenditures will be provided from an array of sources, including:

• \$.83 million in Pay as You Go capital;

- \$20.9 million in other financing sources, including federal earmarks, grants and Chapter 90 funds;
- \$.65 million in ARPA funds.

#### About the City

With 5.7 square miles of land area under its jurisdiction, the City of Revere has substantial infrastructure to manage each year as it safeguards the health and safety of the city's nearly 63,000 residents. Municipal infrastructure - including roadways, parks, buildings, vehicles and equipment, and water, sewer, and drainage systems - also directly affects the quality of life of residents and the business environment. It is no surprise, therefore, that Revere and cities and towns across the country combined expend billions of dollars annually on infrastructure maintenance and improvement.

Revere's population is growing and has been doing so for some time. In fact, between 2010 and 2020, the total population grew from 51,755 to 62,186 (+10,431 residents). Revere is the fastest growing community in the Commonwealth. Per the Department of Revenue's Division of Local Services, the City of Revere has approximately 108 road miles and an income per capita of approximately \$25,000 (with the state average of \$48,000).

Infrastructure components for which the City of Revere is responsible include:

In FY2025, the city will be commencing the process to renovate the historical McKinley School to create a multipurpose building that will house several needed facilities for the city. These facilities include an early childhood education center through Revere Public Schools (utilizing 11,000 sq ft of the building), the relocated Revere Food Hub (approximately 5,000 sq ft), and the remainder of the building devoted to the Metro North Regional Emergency Call Center (MNRECC). This project will be funded through multiple sources, including \$6.9 million through an ESSER grant for early education, \$2 for the food hub, and an estimated \$16 million from State 911 grant for the MNRECC. The total projected cost for the entire project is \$32 million, and it is anticipated that the renovations balance not covered by these other funding sources would be funded through bonding or other city funds.

Parks and Open Space: Abutting the Atlantic Ocean, Revere is home to an array of parks and natural features. More than 20 municipal parks, playgrounds, and open spaces can be found, ranging in size from Beachmont Community Park (0.14 acres) and Neponset Street Park (0.2 acres) to Della Russo Stadium (4.41 acres). Altogether, the City maintains 20.22 acres of active recreational space in fields, parks, and

playgrounds. Another 27.91 acres of City land is used primarily for passive recreation including marsh areas such as the Oak Island Marsh (17.57 acres) and Jacobs Park (5.97 acres), which is undeveloped but available to residents for passive recreation.<sup>2</sup> An additional 33.64 acres of fields and play facilities can be found on school grounds, but are maintained by DPW and are managed by Parks & Recreation. In addition, the Revere Conservation Commission owns 21.46 acres in three locations, the largest of which is the North Revere Conservation Area (21.28 acres).<sup>3</sup>

## The Commonwealth's Responsibilities

The Commonwealth is responsible for maintaining several significant regional open space resources located in Revere including:

- Revere Beach Reservation
  - Revere Beach is owned by DCR and is the oldest public beach in America. It celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1996.
- Belle Isle Marsh
  - The Belle Isle Marsh Reservation, under the jurisdiction of DCR, preserves 152 acres of the 241-acre Belle Isle Marsh, Boston's last remaining salt marsh. In addition to the preservation of the natural areas of the marsh, the DCR manages 28 acres of landscaped park with pathways, benches, and an observation tower.
- Rumney Marsh
  - Rumney Marsh is a 600+ acre reservation located within the rich Saugus and Pines River estuary. This expansive saltmarsh provides habitat for an array of wildlife including migratory birds and marine life.<sup>4</sup>

## Recent City Improvements

In recent years, the City has upgraded several parks, playgrounds, and green space, including the completion of renovations to the Northern Strand, also known as the Bike to the Sea Trail, a 10-mile public use path, including a rail trail portion, which connects the cities of Everett, Malden, Revere, Saugus and Lynn. Also, the city has renovated Gibson Park as part of major upgrades to that neighborhood with the soon to be constructed Gibson Point, a modern apartment community that offers spa-like living with sunset views and on-site dining.

## Riverfront Area Improvements

Additionally, the city has been working on making significant infrastructure improvements to the Riverfront area of the city where Gibson Point and Gibson Park are located. The Mills Ave Construction project will construct a vegetated berm on Mills Ave and reconstruct the revetment at the shoreline of the former boatyard. This project will help protect the Riverside neighborhood from flooding during high tide events, and will offer protection for the neighborhood through 2050 given current sea levels. Funding is supported by a \$700k MVP grant for design and potential federal earmark for construction.

## Riverside Drainage Project

The Riverside drainage project will design and ultimately build an underground drainage system to replace the current antiquated system that exists in the neighborhood that does not adequately provide for stormwater drainage during high precipitation events. The new drainage system will be tied into the vegetated berm for discharge. The two projects have separate, but related, purposes and will work together to help mitigate the flooding problem that occurs regularly in this neighborhood.

In FY2023, the city took possession of the McMackin Little League Field, which had been a staple in the Revere community for more than

60 years, but had not been in use since 2014. The McMackin Field project will involve the joint renovation of the field as well as the building across the street at 200 Winthrop Ave. The two locations together will form a recreation and open space campus. The city has begun working with engineering firms to design drainage to help with the flooding. Also, the city is working internally to fill the park with clean fill to help offset what would otherwise be done by outside vendors. Current estimates for McMackin Field are approximately \$3.75 million.

Roadways and Sidewalks: A network of approximately 117 miles of public and private roadways can be found in Revere. These include local streets, collector streets, and arterial roadways:

- Local streets comprise a majority of Revere's roadway network and provide direct access to residential properties and serve the transportation needs within a particular neighborhood.
- Collector streets primarily collect traffic off local streets and lead such traffic to and from arterial roadways. Examples of collector streets include Malden Street and Revere Street.
- Arterial roadways are typically numbered and serve regional and local automobile and truck traffic. Examples include Route 60 (Squire Road and American Legion Highway), Route 1A (North Shore Road), and Route 16 (Revere Beach Parkway). These roadways are maintained by the state and function as part of the regional highway system.

While many streets have curbs and sidewalks consistent with City standards, a sizeable number do not. The streets between Squire Road and Malden Street stand out as not having curbs or sidewalks, but there are many other streets in similar condition. Curbs are an important component to the storm drainage as they channel water into culverts and sidewalks are important for pedestrian safety.

Several years ago, the City contracted with StreetScan to analyze the condition of every local road which will provide the information needed to plan a street repair and replacement program. Past estimates were that as much as 40% of Revere's streets may not be up to appropriate standards. The City has since invested a significant amount of money on addressing these substandard streets, including a \$5 million bond authorization in FY2022 that will be exhausted by the end of FY2025. It is estimated that the City will bond an additional \$3 million in FY2026 to continue with the pavement management plan. These bond proceeds will be matched up with funding from Chapter 90 to continue with citywide roadway and sidewalk improvements over the next five years.

Three Blue Line transit stations - Beachmont, Revere Beach, and Wonderland – managed by the MBTA take some of the burden off of local streets by providing residents and employees with options on how to get from work to home and elsewhere, In addition, multiple MBTA bus routes cross the city, offering access to neighborhoods (e.g., routes 119 and 110, among others), T Stations (e.g., routes 116 and 411, among others), and directly to downtown Boston (e.g., routes 424, 434, and 450, among others). These buses travel predominantly on collector and arterial roadways but may also use local streets on occasion.

School Facilities: The Revere School District operates ten school facilities including six elementary schools, three middle schools, and the high school, as well as Seacoast Academy. School administration is located at 101 School Street. Each of these facilities includes associated play equipment and fields.

The City has completed a \$4.3 million feasibility study for a new high school. The feasibility study resulted in a vote of the Revere Building Committee and City Council for construction at the former site of the Wonderland Dog Track. The city has since taken the 33-acre parcel via eminent domain for \$29.5 million and is in the process of design and development for a new school to be constructed by 2028-2029. Construction costs of a new high school is estimated at \$493 million dollars, with an anticipated effective reimbursement of approximately 45% of eligible costs. As such, we have a placeholder in the Capital Improvement Plan for \$493 million, with \$234 million coming from the MSBA in the form of a grant. This leaves \$259 million to be bonded upon completion. These bonds will be staggered out over multiple years, with final debt service to begin in FY2031. It is anticipated that the city share of the debt service can be supported by the new growth expected from developments at Suffolk Downs, Route 1A, Revere Beach and other areas throughout the City.

The schools have been authorized through the MSBA's accelerated repairs program for a new boiler at the Beachmont School as well as new windows and doors at the Lincoln School. The city appropriated \$120k for studies of both projects and has now received approval on both projects. We expect that the MSBA will fund approximately 77% of the total costs of each project. We have earmarked \$2.6 million for the new boiler and \$3.6 million for the new windows and doors.

Sewer: The City's wastewater collection system consists of about 98 miles of separated sanitary sewer with most of the system constructed of vitrified clay pipe with brick manholes. Pipe sizes range from 6" to 36" in diameter with some larger oval shaped trunk sewers. About 75% of these pipes are 8" in diameter. Stormwater enters a separate drainage system, which was designed to keep stormwater and sanitary sewage separate. On average, the City of Revere produces 7.5 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater (or sewerage) that is sent to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) Deer Island facility for treatment.

The City of Revere is one of 43 communities in the Greater Boston Metropolitan Area included in the sanitary sewage collection system service area of the MWRA. Most of the sewage from the municipal system flows through a 36" x 48" brick arched sewer to the MWRA twin 36" siphon near Slade's Mill. The brick arched sewer high-end portion is referred to as the Harris Street Tunnel and the entire line is the main interceptor sewer in the City. The low-lying area along Revere Beach Parkway from Vinal Street westerly across Broadway to Olive Street discharges through a separate 10" connection at the siphon. A 12" connection at the MWRA system on Washington Avenue near the Chelsea line serves a portion of the southwest corner of the City.

Trunk sewers extend from the brick sewer to various sections of the City. Because the city's topography alternates between low lying and hilly, a purely gravity-based sanitary sewer system is not feasible. Instead, sanitary sewage pumping stations exist in multiple locations including Atwood Street, Dix Street, Furlong Drive, Goldie Street, Linehurst Road, the Lynnway, Malden Street, Marshview Terrace, Milano Avenue, North Marshall Street, Salem Street (Waitt Park), Sherman Street, and Washburn Avenue. In addition, the Garfield School, Hill School, the High School, and Della Russo Stadium all have on-site pumps that elevate waste so that it reaches the City's sewer lines. Some streets still have homes with septic disposal systems. Revere Beach Parkway from Olive Street to Borden Street and some parts of North Revere and some properties on Route 1 are among the areas without municipal sewage collection.

Revere faces a significant challenge that is not unusual to older, urban cities with aging sewer systems. During heavy rains, storm water can enter sewer pipes via cracks in pipes and sometimes direct connections between private roof drains or sump pumps, or in-street catch basins, and the sewer system which can exceed pipe capacity and cause sanitary sewage overflows at the surface and ultimately enters various streams and rivers in an unpermitted manner. This environmental and public health issue has been cause for concern for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) and, in November 2010, the EPA, MassDEP, and the City of Revere entered a Consent Decree (CD) that requires the City to detect and eliminate sanitary sewer overflows. Failure to comply with the decree has significant financial penalties and, if the City is making progress yet fails to meet decree deadlines, escalating daily fines could still be incurred.

The City's response to the requirements of the CD has been in progress since 2010. As required each year, the City and its consultants methodically investigate sections of the City's wastewater collection system to determine if infiltration and inflow (I/I) is occurring and what improvements are needed. The construction work to resolve the problem is then scheduled shortly thereafter. Work can include adding a cured-in-place pipe liner (CIPPL) made of fiberglass into older sewer pipes, disconnecting sources of illegal inflow, and replacing collapsed pipes, replacing dilapidated old pump stations, and many other activities necessary to operate and maintain the City's sewer system.

In recent years, the City Council has authorized extensive borrowing that will be repaid by water/sewer enterprise fund revenues to meet the CD's obligations. This recent multi-million-dollar investment is making progress toward the CD's rigorous timelines but has come after decades of limited investment in sewer and storm water infrastructure. As the continued investigations reveal the extent of the challenges facing Revere, City officials have worked with the EPA and MassDEP to extend the schedule of work required under the CD. An extension has been granted to give the City more time to complete the work and the associated debt has been forecasted in the capital plan. This

extension will help reduce the annual financial impact on City ratepayers from year to year, however, the total costs will ultimately be borne by the rate payers, with some relief from grant programs through the MWRA and debt forgiveness through the Clean Water Trust. For FY2025, the city will seek \$3 million worth of bonds to continue with the work necessary to comply with the Consent Decree.

Storm Water Collection: Surrounded on nearly all sides by water (Belle Isle Marsh to the south, Rumney Marsh to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east), the city is located partially within the Saugus River Watershed and partially within the Mystic River Watershed. Although some parts of Revere are very low lying, other areas are quite hilly. This topography, coupled with varying soil characteristics (e.g., sand, peat, clay, and ledge), and the influence of tides in the Atlantic and the two marshes affects the local water table and makes managing storm water runoff very challenging and complex in Revere. In addition, the Town Line Brook along the northern portion of Revere is tidally influenced and carries storm water from Revere and neighboring communities to the ocean.

The City of Revere's drainage system is primarily a gravity flow system with 13 large drainage areas containing 23 smaller sub-areas. However, pump stations owned by the City and or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are located on many streets in Revere to lift water from low lying areas into the storm drains.

Due to the City being in very close proximity to the ocean and in some cases at or below sea level, its infrastructure is significantly influenced by the rising and falling tides. As a result, the City and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts maintain several tide gates throughout Revere which open and close to facilitate a natural water flow that keeps streams and marshes healthy while also preventing flooding. The tide gates are designed to prevent high tide water from rising into the streets and the storm water system to prevent flooding of City and private property. Generally, the gates operate by opening and allowing water to exit the City's drainage system during low tide. Then, they automatically close when the tide starts to rise, preventing water from entering the system. The gates are set to allow some sea water upstream to flush the system regularly. However, in some cases where a high tide has closed a gate and heavy rains are inundating the City's system, flooding can still occur. Tide gates are located on Route 1 (Cutler Highway inlet of Townline Brook), Martin Street (inlet of Central County Ditch), and Oak Island (inlet of Eastern County Ditch), among others. It is critical that all City tide gates are maintained and operate properly. It is equally important that all tributary ditches, channels, culverts, etc. are maintained and cleaned as well. The importance of the tide gates was evident when the Oak Island gate malfunctioned in December 2014 and extensive flooding occurred.

Hydrant and gate valve replacement is a critical part of water system maintenance. Hydrant replacement increases fire protection, system reliability and water quality while gate valve replacement improves system control and operation. This project will occur throughout the City, at various locations where hydrants are out of service or at risk and where gate valves are inoperable or non-existent.

Many areas of the City of Revere, especially those areas that were at one time comprised of primarily summer residences, lack sufficient drainage facilities. As described in the City's Open Space and Recreation Plan, City staff have identified eight flood hazard areas.

• Roughan's Point – Although the Army Corps of Engineers completed a flood protection project to prevent coastal flooding in this area, a 100-year storm could still result in flooding of streets and low-lying properties. The Broadsound Avenue pump station is designed to handle flooding on Broadsound Avenue.

- Lower Revere Street and Kelley's Meadows These areas are adjacent to the Eastern County Ditch and vulnerable to flooding caused by heavy rainfall and coinciding high tides.
- Mills Avenue During high lunar tides, this residential neighborhood floods approximately three feet. This flooding generally recedes as soon as the tide goes out. A sea wall would offer protection for this neighborhood. Due to repeated flooding, the roadway is starting to erode.
- Rice Avenue There is a short sea wall on Rice Avenue, but it stops at Harrington Avenue. Flooding in this area would be mitigated by completing the gap in the sea wall at Harrington Avenue.
- Garfield School The area in the vicinity of the Garfield School floods. There are ditches maintained by the MBTA along the tracks. These ditches need to be cleaned out to restore their storage capacity. Because there was an oil spill here 30 years ago, nothing can be done in this area until the soil is removed.
- Town Line Brook Town Line Brook near the Malden line floods. There is a set of self-regulating tide gates on Route 1A.
- DPW Yard There is flooding that occurs at the DPW yard.

A section of the stormwater collection system on Fenno St. receives stormwater flow from Fenno's Hill and Ridge Rd. It then discharges the flow to the system on Penn St. During significant rainfall events, the system on Fenno St. surcharges, causing flooding of the street and nearby properties. Improvements to the Fenno St. section of the system, along with downstream improvements to the system on Penn St. will be constructed to alleviate the surcharging that is currently occurring. In FY2025, the city will be using \$1 million in bonded money and \$500 thousand of Inflow/Infiltration funds to address this area. Further drainage projects for FY2025 include \$1 million for drainage improvements in the Library Ave neighborhood and an estimated \$15.7 million over the next five years to address stormwater drainage issues citywide.

Vehicles and Equipment: Many City departments, such as DPW, Fire Department, Parking Clerk, and Police Department, use small and large vehicles and equipment on a daily basis. A recent inventory of DPW equipment found that the department uses and maintains more than 60 on- and off-road vehicles (e.g., dump truck, Vactor, pickups, mowers, etc.). DPW staff also use countless handheld pieces of equipment (e.g., asphalt compactors, shovels and other ground maintenance tools, and hand tools such as wrenches) which typically have short lifespans. The Fire Department operates six fire engines, three engines with ladders, and several smaller vehicles including SUVs and pickups. The department also has five boats for water rescues, an ATV, and some trailers for oxygen and oil spill cleanup, among other uses. In order to replace older firefighting equipment, the city committed over \$3 million of ARPA funds for the purchase of one new ladder truck and two new pumper trucks. These vehicles are in production with an anticipated delivery date of the fall of calendar year 2025.

As part of the annual Capital Improvement Budget submittal, and the five-year Capital Improvement Plan, the budget team continues to work with all departments to determine the needs of vehicles, equipment, and other capital items of this nature to try to balance the costs of new equipment vs. the costs of maintaining older, less reliable vehicles and equipment.

Water: The City maintains 107 miles of water distribution main piping that provides potable water to all occupied properties. In addition to

water mains, the City owns and operates 1,630 gate valves, 823 hydrants, and 11,810 service meters. Approximately 4 million gallons per day of potable water is purchased from the MWRA and enters the City's system through a series of six metered connections to the MWRA distribution system (four connections are currently active). The Revere water distribution system consists of three separate pressure zones which are isolated using pressure reducing valves, check valves, and closed gate valves. The entire City is fed solely from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) Northern High-pressure zone.

As part of the municipal water system, the City maintains one of the last reservoirs (Thomas Carroll Way Storage Facility) in the area. However, due to the service capabilities of the MWRA, the City reservoir is obsolete and, in turn, currently not an active part of the system. Plans are being made to decommission the reservoir permanently.

In 2016, the City completed a report summarizing an evaluation of the water distribution system. This report also describes an asset management program needed to determine and report on the water system improvements required to address existing system deficiencies (including pressure, flow, and water quality). The report further evaluates future water demand projected through the year 2035 and identifies the water distribution system piping and facility improvements that are required to adequately serve Revere's needs over the next 20 years. The asset management component of the report provides the City with a long-term plan for system improvements that is based on the risk and consequence of failure for each asset in the City's distributing system, and to use risk and consequence factors to rank each asset. The report outlines a series of annual capital improvements that consist primarily of removing old pipes and replacing them with new mains, valves, and hydrants. In addition, the City has outlined the need to remove the old reservoir which is no longer in use and to upgrade the City's potable water pumping system in the first years of the CIP.

Sections of the City's water distribution system were installed prior to 1950 and are aging, failing and inadequate. Replacement of these older sections will improve fire protection, system control & reliability and water quality. The city just completed water line replacement on 16 streets in the Library St. – Sewall St. neighborhood, with Harris St. and Beach St. to be completed over FY2025 and FY2026 respectively.

After an initial investment of \$5.9 for the Library-Sewell St. area, the city will look to invest over \$12 million through FY2029 on various water main replacement projects in the city, including Ocean Ave from Eliot Circle to Shirley Ave., Broadway and Geneva St. Future repairs are estimated to cost \$3.3 million for FY2028 and FY2029, with locations to be determined after further analysis of the system by the City's Water and Sewer Department.

Further, for FY2025 and beyond, the City will tackle deferred repairs and maintenance of water mains citywide using programs through the MWRA. This includes a potential \$1.88 million bond for lead service replacement citywide and \$532,000 annually from the MWRA's water system improvements loan program (LWSAP). The lead service program from the MWRA is a lead service line replacement program. In FY2024-2025, the City performed over 200 test pits and removed 80 lead services in 2024. The long-term plan is to eliminate the rest of any lead services in the City using the MWRA loan program.

Per our most recently completed inventory of lead service replacements needed, we've estimated that there are still 461 lead services and

578 unknown lines. With the funds requested from the MWRA for lead service replacement, the goal is to continue removing lead services until the City is lead free. We are working with GLO to perform 400 test pits starting in April 2025 which will help reduce the number of unknown lines and identify lead services due for replacement. This project will continue to evolve as we gather more information about lead services in the City.

#### Capital Funding Sources

There are several ways to finance capital improvement projects. Some of the most common methods are:

#### Local Resources

- Municipal Indebtedness: The most used method of financing large capital projects is general obligation bonds. They are issued for a period ranging from 5 to 30 years, during which time principal and interest payments are made. Payments over time have the advantage of allowing capital expenditures to be amortized over the life of the project. Funding sources used to pay back the debt can include:
- Bonds funded within the tax limits of Proposition 2 ½: Debt service for these bonds must be paid within the tax levy limitations of proposition 2 ½. Funds used for this debt must be carefully planned to not impact the annual operating budget.
- Bonds funded outside the tax limits of Proposition 2 ½: Debt service for these bonds is paid by increasing local property taxes in an amount needed to pay the annual debt service. Known as Debt Exclusions/Exempt Debt, funding requires approval by 2/3 vote of the local appropriating authority (City Council or Town Meeting) and approval of majority of voters participating in a ballot vote. Prior to the vote, the impact on the tax rate is determined so voters can understand the financial implications.
- Bonds funded with Enterprise Funds: Debt service for these bonds is typically paid by user fees, such as water and sewer revenue. Interest costs are often subsidized by the Commonwealth and at times partial grant funds may be available (see below). Enterprise funds do not affect the general operating budget unless general funds are needed to subsidize the water and sewer revenues. These projects must be analyzed for their impact on the water or sewer rate.
- Capital Outlay / Pay As You Go: Pay as You Go capital projects are funded with current revenues and the entire cost is paid off within one year. Projects funded with current revenues are customarily lower in cost than those funded by general obligation bonds. If a city or town has the financial capacity to pay for the project in one year, the cost to the taxpayer will be less than if bonded because there are no interest costs. Funds used for this purpose must be carefully planned to not impact the annual operating budget.
- Capital Outlay / Expenditure Exclusion: Expenditure Exclusion projects are like Pay as You Go, above, except taxes are raised outside the limits of Proposition 2 ½ and are added to the tax levy only during the year in which the project is being funded. As with a Debt Exclusion, Expenditure Exclusion funding requires approval by 2/3 vote of the local appropriating authority (City Council or Town Meeting) and approval of majority of voters participating in a ballot vote. Prior to the vote, the impact on the tax rate is determined so voters can understand the financial implications. Capital outlay expenditures may be authorized for any municipal purpose for which the city or town would be authorized to borrow money.
- Capital Stabilization Fund: Local officials can set aside money in a stabilization fund outside of the general fund to pay for all or a portion of future capital projects. A 2/3 vote of the city council is required to appropriate money into and out of this fund.
- Sale of Surplus Real Property: Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, when real estate is sold, the proceeds must first be used to pay any

debt incurred in the purchase of the property. If no debt is outstanding, the funds "may be used for any purpose or purposes for which the city, town or district is authorized to incur debt for a period of five years or more...except that the proceeds of a sale in excess of five hundred dollars of any park land by a city, town, or district shall be used only by said city, town, or district for acquisition of land for park purposes or for capital improvements to park land" (MGL Chapter 44, Sec. 63).

- Enterprise Retained Earnings / Stabilization Fund: Enterprise operations, such as water and sewer, can maintain operating surplus to be utilized for future enterprise fund costs. These funds can be used to stabilize the user rates, apply to annual budget needs, and/or invest in capital replacement and expansion.
- Municipal Infiltration and Inflow (I/I) Fund: This is a revolving account funded by large development projects. To obtain a sewer connection permit and tie into the Revere sewer system, the developer is required to contribute a sum to this fund. The sum is determined by a calculation dependent upon the number of gallons of wastewater generated by the project daily. The calculation is ten times the daily amount of wastewater times \$1.30. Monies in this fund are utilized for sewer and drainage infrastructure improvements.
- Free Cash: Free Cash is the difference between annual revenues and expenditures and is certified by the Commonwealth each year. After certification, free cash is available for appropriation for any municipal purpose.
- Special Purpose Funds: Communities also have established numerous "Special Purpose Accounts" for which the use is restricted for a specific purpose, some of which may be investment in department facilities and equipment. There are numerous state statutes that govern the establishment and use of these separate accounts. Examples include the sale of cemetery lots and off-street parking fees accounts.

#### Special Revenue Sources

Special revenue sources include state and federal funds and private grants. Examples include:

- Federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): In 2020, as Revere's population exceed 62,000 residents, it became a U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) "entitlement" community, meaning that it was eligible to receive direct funds from HUD, rather than through the Commonwealth. To secure the funds, the City must prepare a Consolidated Plan every five years outlining the City's goals for use of the funds. In addition, an annual plan must be prepared each year.
- Massachusetts Chapter 90 Roadway Funds: Each year, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (Mass DOT) allocates funds to cities and towns for road maintenance and construction, and equipment. The funding calculation takes into account: a) total miles of public ways, excluding state highways (calculated at \$400 per mile); b) the number of local vehicles, which is used account for intensity of road use (\$7 times # vehicles registered in the city/town divided by the number of miles of roadway); and c) local property values (deduction of 10 cents times the total aggregate property values divided by the number of miles of roadway).
- Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection's Dam and Seawall Repair and Removal Program: This program was created in 2013 to provide funding to municipalities to repair and remove dams, levees, seawalls, and other forms of flood control. The Dam and Seawall program offers loans at 2% interest on up to \$1 million per project, with a minimum 25% match to be provided by the municipality.
- Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection's State Revolving Loan Funds (SRF): The Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund (CWSRF) provides financing for sewer and drainage projects intended to reduce sewer overflows and the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF) provides financing to improve the quality of the drinking water system. Both programs typically offer a mix of low interest (2%)

loans and grant funds. Repayment does not begin until two years after the monies have been borrowed.

- Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) The MSBA provides funding for school design and construction. Projects must be accepted into the process in response to the submission of a Statement of Interest which identifies a facility problem to be solved. Subsequently, the community must appropriate funding for schematic design and later for construction before the MSBA will commit to its share of the project. If accepted, the MSBA determines the amount of reimbursement it will offer based upon community need, with a minimum base rate of 31%. The percent of reimbursement can then be increased based upon three factors: community income factor, community property wealth factor, and community poverty factor.
- Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) Loan and Grant Programs: The MWRA offers two predominant forms of assistance. The Inflow and Infiltration Program (I/I) provides funding in the form of 45% grant and 55% loan to separate storm water from the sewer system. The Local Pipeline Assistance Program funds work on the water system through a ten-year, no-interest loan program. The goal of the pipeline assistance program is to address older water mains that "need to be replaced or cleaned and lined to prevent tuberculation (rust build-up), loss of disinfectant residual, and potential bacteria growth." Many of these pipes were constructed of unlined cast iron pipe. Just under 1/3 of pipes across the MWRA service area remain unlined; in Revere, this figure is 46%.

Many state departments also offer annual competitive grant opportunities that could be made available to the City in future years including, but not limited to: Green Community grants (project to improve sustainability), Parkland Acquisitions and Renovations for Communities grants (PARC), and the Mass Works Infrastructure Program.

The following schedule represents the City's five-year CIP as amended during the FY2025 budget process. This document is always evolving based upon departmental needs, available funding, and grant awards.

# Departmental Fund Relationships

This table illustrates the relationship between functional units, major funds, and nonmajor funds in the aggregate. It further indicates which funds are appropriated by the City Council prior to June 30 for the following fiscal year.

Trust and Agency funds are not directly appropriated; a Council Order is needed to appropriate funds into other accounts from which the money can be spent.

The GASB function is important because external financial reporting can demonstrate financial accountability to the public and is the basis for investment, credit, and many legislative and regulatory decisions. The mission of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board is to establish and improve standards of state and local governmental accounting and financial reporting that will result in useful information for users of financial reports and guide and educate the public, including issuers, auditors, and users of those financial reports. More information, including all statements, can be found at www.gasb.org.

Line-item Budget - A format of budgeting which organizes costs by object of expenditure such as supplies, equipment, maintenance, or salaries.

Major Funds - There are two types of major governmental funds – General Funds and Enterprise Funds. These funds are voted as part of the annual city budget. The General Fund is the major operating fund of municipal governments, and it accounts for most municipal operations. The General Fund is supported by revenues from real estate and personal property taxes, state and federal aid, excise taxes, investment income, fines and forfeitures, and fees and charges.

Most of the municipal departments, including the schools, are supported in whole or in part by the General Fund. Enterprise funds are used to account for operations (a) that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprises – where the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses, including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or (b) where the governing body has decided the periodic determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability or other purposes.
